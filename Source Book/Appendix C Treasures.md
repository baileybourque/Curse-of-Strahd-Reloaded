# Appendix C: Treasures

Scattered throughout Barovia are ancient treasures that can be brought to bear against Strahd von Zarovich and his fell servants. The locations of three of them—the _Tome of Strahd_, the [Holy Symbol of Ravenkind](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/5529-holy-symbol-of-ravenkind), and the [Sunsword](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/5532-sunsword)—are determined by the results of the card reading in [chapter 1](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/cos/into-the-mists#CardReading "chapter 1"). The other items can be acquired as characters discover their whereabouts during the course of the adventure.

[![](https://www.dndbeyond.com/attachments/thumbnails/1/842/300/294/cos18-01.png)](https://www.dndbeyond.com/attachments/1/842/cos18-01.png)

The _Tome of Strahd_ is an ancient work penned by Strahd, a tragic tale of how he came to his fallen state. The book is bound in a thick leather cover with steel hinges and fastenings. The pages are of parchment and very brittle. Most of the book is written in the curious shorthand that only Strahd employs. Stains and age have made most of the work illegible, but several paragraphs remain intact and readable. If the characters acquire the _Tome of Strahd_ and want to read these paragraphs, show the players the “[From the Tome of Strahd](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/cos/appendix-f-handouts#FromtheTomeofStrahd "From the Tome of Strahd")” section in [appendix F](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/cos/appendix-f-handouts "appendix F").

If Strahd sees, or learns from a minion, that the tome has fallen into the party’s possession, all of his other objectives (see chapter 1, “[Into the Mists](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/cos/into-the-mists "Into the Mists")”) are put on hold until the book is recovered. When Strahd attacks, his preferred target is whoever has the tome.

The magic items described here, if they are found, can play significant roles in the adventure.

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/cos/appendix-c-treasures#BloodSpear)[Blood Spear](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/5527-blood-spear)

[![](https://www.dndbeyond.com/attachments/thumbnails/1/843/200/296/cos18-02.png)](https://www.dndbeyond.com/attachments/1/843/cos18-02.png)

_Weapon (spear), uncommon (requires attunement)_

Kavan was a ruthless chieftain whose tribe lived in the Balinok Mountains centuries before the arrival of Strahd von Zarovich. Although he was very much alive, Kavan had some traits in common with vampires: he slept during the day and hunted at night, he drank the blood of his prey, and he lived underground. In battle, he wielded a spear stained with blood. His was the first [blood spear](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/5527-blood-spear), a weapon that drains life from those it kills and transfers that life to its wielder, imbuing that individual with the stamina to keep fighting.

When you hit with a melee attack using this magic spear and reduce the target to 0 hit points, you gain 2d6 temporary hit points.

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/cos/appendix-c-treasures#GulthiasStaff)[Gulthias Staff](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/5528-gulthias-staff)

[![](https://www.dndbeyond.com/attachments/thumbnails/1/844/300/444/cos18-03.png)](https://www.dndbeyond.com/attachments/1/844/cos18-03.png)

_Staff, rare (requires attunement)_

Made from the branch of a Gulthias tree (see the [blights entry](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm/monsters-b#Blights "Monster Manual - Blights") in the [Monster Manual](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm "Monster Manual")), a [Gulthias staff](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/5528-gulthias-staff) is a spongy, black length of wood. Its evil makes beasts visibly uncomfortable while within 30 feet of it. The staff has 10 charges and regains 1d6 + 4 of its expended charges daily at dusk.

If the staff is broken or burned to ashes, its wood releases a terrible, inhuman scream that can be heard out to a range of 300 feet. All blights that can hear the scream immediately wither and die.

_**Vampiric Strike.**_ The staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff. On a hit, it deals damage as a normal quarterstaff, and you can expend 1 charge to regain a number of hit points equal to the damage dealt by the weapon. Each time a charge is spent, red blood oozes from the staff’s pores, and you must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be afflicted with short-term madness (see “[Madness](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/running-the-game#Madness "Madness")” in chapter 8 of the [Dungeon Master’s Guide](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg "Dungeon Master’s Guide")).

_**Blight Bane.**_ While you are attuned to the staff, blights and other evil plant creatures don’t regard you as hostile unless you harm them.

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/cos/appendix-c-treasures#HolySymbolofRavenkind)[Holy Symbol of Ravenkind](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/5529-holy-symbol-of-ravenkind)

[![](https://www.dndbeyond.com/attachments/thumbnails/1/845/280/365/cos18-04.png)](https://www.dndbeyond.com/attachments/1/845/cos18-04.png)

_Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a cleric or paladin of good alignment)_

The [Holy Symbol of Ravenkind](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/5529-holy-symbol-of-ravenkind) is a unique holy symbol sacred to the good-hearted faithful of Barovia. It predates the establishment of any church in Barovia. According to legend, it was delivered to a paladin named Lugdana by a giant raven—or an angel in the form of a giant raven. Lugdana used the holy symbol to root out and destroy nests of vampires until her death. The high priests of Ravenloft kept and wore the holy symbol after Lugdana’s passing.

The holy symbol is a platinum amulet shaped like the sun, with a large crystal embedded in its center.

The holy symbol has 10 charges for the following properties. It regains 1d6 + 4 charges daily at dawn.

_**Hold Vampires.**_ As an action, you can expend 1 charge and present the holy symbol to make it flare with holy power. Vampires and vampire spawn within 30 feet of the holy symbol when it flares must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a target is [paralyzed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ParalyzedCondition) for 1 minute. It can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns to end the effect on itself.

_**Turn Undead.**_ If you have the Turn Undead or the Turn the Unholy feature, you can expend 3 charges when you present the holy symbol while using that feature. When you do so, undead have disadvantage on their saving throws against the effect.

_**Sunlight.**_ As an action, you can expend 5 charges while presenting the holy symbol to make it shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. The light is sunlight and lasts for 10 minutes or until you end the effect (no action required).

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/cos/appendix-c-treasures#IconofRavenloft)[Icon of Ravenloft](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/5530-icon-of-ravenloft)

[![](https://www.dndbeyond.com/attachments/thumbnails/1/846/250/415/cos18-05.png)](https://www.dndbeyond.com/attachments/1/846/cos18-05.png)

_Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a creature of good alignment)_

The [Icon of Ravenloft](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/5530-icon-of-ravenloft) is a 12-inch-tall statuette made of the purest silver, weighing 10 pounds. It depicts a cleric kneeling in supplication.

The icon was given to Strahd by the archpriest Ciril Romulich, an old family friend, to consecrate the castle and its chapel.

While within 30 feet of the icon, a creature is under the effect of a [protection from evil and good](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2221-protection-from-evil-and-good) spell against fiends and undead. Only a creature attuned to the icon can use its other properties.

_**Augury.**_ You can use an action to cast an [augury](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2007-augury) spell from the icon, with no material components required. Once used, this property can’t be used again until the next dawn.

_**Bane of the Undead.**_ You can use the icon as a holy symbol while using the Turn Undead or Turn the Unholy feature. If you do so, increase the save DC by 2.

_**Cure Wounds.**_ While holding the icon, you can take an action to heal one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. The target regains 3d8 + 3 hit points, unless it is an undead, a construct, or a fiend. Once used, this property can’t be used again until the next dawn.

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/cos/appendix-c-treasures#SaintMarkoviasThighbone)[Saint Markovia’s Thighbone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/5531-saint-markovias-thighbone)

[![](https://www.dndbeyond.com/attachments/thumbnails/1/847/270/364/cos18-06.png)](https://www.dndbeyond.com/attachments/1/847/cos18-06.png)

_Weapon (mace), rare (requires attunement)_

[Saint Markovia’s thighbone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/5531-saint-markovias-thighbone) has the properties of a [mace of disruption](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4670-mace-of-disruption). If it scores one or more hits against a vampire or a vampire spawn in the course of a single battle, the thighbone crumbles into dust once the battle concludes.

As a youth, Markovia followed her heart and became a priest of the Morninglord soon after her eighteenth birthday. She proved to be a charismatic proselytizer and, before the age of thirty, had gained a reputation for allowing no evil to stand before her.

Markovia had long considered Strahd a mad tyrant, but only after his transformation into a vampire did she dare to challenge him. As she rallied her followers and prepared to march on Castle Ravenloft, Strahd sent a group of vampire spawn to her abbey. They confronted Markovia and were destroyed to a one.

Suffused with confidence born of righteous victory, Markovia advanced on Castle Ravenloft. A great battle raged from the catacombs to the parapets. In the end, Markovia never returned to Barovia, and Strahd long afterward walked with a limp and a grimace of pain. It is said that he trapped Markovia in a crypt beneath his castle, and her remains linger there yet.

The essence of Markovia’s saintliness passed partly into her bones as the rest of her body decomposed. Her remaining thighbone is imbued with power that inflicts grievous injury on the undead.

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/cos/appendix-c-treasures#Sunsword)[Sunsword](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/5532-sunsword)

[![](https://www.dndbeyond.com/attachments/thumbnails/1/848/300/375/cos18-07.png)](https://www.dndbeyond.com/attachments/1/848/cos18-07.png)

_Weapon (longsword), legendary (requires attunement)_

The [Sunsword](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/5532-sunsword) is a unique blade once possessed by Strahd’s brother, Sergei von Zarovich. In its original form, it had a platinum hilt and guard, and a thin crystal blade as strong as steel.

Strahd employed a powerful wizard named Khazan to destroy the weapon after Sergei’s death. The first part of the process required the hilt and the blade to be separated, which Khazan accomplished. While Khazan was busying himself destroying the blade, his apprentice stole the hilt and fled. Khazan later located his apprentice’s mutilated corpse in the Svalich Woods, but the hilt was nowhere to be found. To avoid the vampire’s wrath, Khazan told Strahd that the entire weapon had been destroyed.

The hilt, which is sentient, knows that it can never be reunited with its original crystal blade. It has, however, gained the properties of a [sun blade](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4774-sun-blade).

_**Sentience.**_ The [Sunsword](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/5532-sunsword) is a sentient chaotic good weapon with an Intelligence of 11, a Wisdom of 17, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and normal vision out to a range of 60 feet. The weapon communicates by transmitting emotions to the creature carrying or wielding it.

_**Personality.**_ The [Sunsword's](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/5532-sunsword) special purpose is to destroy Strahd, not so much because it wants to free the land of Barovia from evil but because it wants revenge for the loss of its crystal blade. The weapon secretly fears its own destruction.
