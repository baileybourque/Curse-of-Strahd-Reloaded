# Appendix A: Character Options

During character creation, players can select the following background for their characters, with your approval. It is appropriate for any character or campaign associated with eeriness or horror.

## [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/cos/appendix-a-character-options#HauntedOne)Haunted One

You are haunted by something so terrible that you dare not speak of it. You’ve tried to bury it and run away from it, to no avail. Whatever this thing is that haunts you can’t be slain with a sword or banished with a spell. It might come to you as a shadow on the wall, a bloodcurdling nightmare, a memory that refuses to die, or a demonic whisper in the dark. The burden has taken its toll, isolating you from most people and making you question your sanity. You must find a way to overcome it before it destroys you.

**Skill Proficiencies:** Choose two of [Arcana](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills), [Investigation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills), [Religion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills), or [Survival](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)

**Languages:** Choose two, one of which is exotic. (Abyssal, Celestial, Deep Speech, Draconic, Infernal, Primordial, Sylvan, or Undercommon)

**Equipment:** [Monster hunter’s pack](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/191-monster-hunters-pack) (see sidebar), one trinket of special significance (choose one or roll on the [Gothic Trinkets](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/cos/appendix-a-character-options#GothicTrinkets "Gothic Trinkets") table in this appendix). Also gain a [set of common clothes](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/38-clothes-common) and 1 sp.

**MONSTER HUNTER'S PACK**

You can buy a [monster hunter’s pack](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/191-monster-hunters-pack) for 33 gp, which is cheaper than buying the items in it individually. It includes a [chest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/36-chest), a [crowbar](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/43-crowbar), a [hammer](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/47-hammer), three [wooden stakes](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/206-stake-wooden), a [holy symbol](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/213-holy-symbol), a [flask of holy water](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/50-holy-water-flask), a [set of manacles](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/60-manacles), a [steel mirror](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/62-mirror-steel), a [flask of oil](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/63-oil-flask), a [tinderbox](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/90-tinderbox), and 3 [torches](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/91-torch).

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/cos/appendix-a-character-options#FeatureHeartofDarkness)Feature: Heart of Darkness

Those who look into your eyes can see that you have faced unimaginable horror and that you are no stranger to darkness. Though they might fear you, commoners will extend you every courtesy and do their utmost to help you. Unless you have shown yourself to be a danger to them, they will even take up arms to fight alongside you, should you find yourself facing an enemy alone.

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/cos/appendix-a-character-options#HarrowingEvent)Harrowing Event

Prior to becoming an adventurer, your path in life was defined by one dark moment, one fateful decision, or one tragedy. Now you feel a darkness threatening to consume you, and you fear there may be no hope of escape. Choose a harrowing event that haunts you, or roll one on the Harrowing Events table.

|d10|Event|
|---|---|
|1|A monster that slaughtered dozens of innocent people spared your life, and you don’t know why.|
|2|You were born under a dark star. You can feel it watching you, coldly and distantly. Sometimes it beckons you in the dead of night.|
|3|An apparition that has haunted your family for generations now haunts you. You don’t know what it wants, and it won’t leave you alone.|
|4|Your family has a history of practicing the dark arts. You dabbled once and felt something horrible clutch at your soul, whereupon you fled in terror.|
|5|An oni took your sibling one cold, dark night, and you were unable to stop it.|
|6|You were cursed with lycanthropy and later cured. You are now haunted by the innocents you slaughtered.|
|7|A hag kidnapped and raised you. You escaped, but the hag still has a magical hold over you and fills your mind with evil thoughts.|
|8|You opened an eldritch tome and saw things unfit for a sane mind. You burned the book, but its words and images are burned into your psyche.|
|9|A fiend possessed you as a child. You were locked away but escaped. The fiend is still inside you, but now you try to keep it locked away.|
|10|You did terrible things to avenge the murder of someone you loved. You became a monster, and it haunts your waking dreams.|

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/cos/appendix-a-character-options#SuggestedCharacteristics)Suggested Characteristics

You have learned to live with the terror that haunts you. You are a survivor, who can be very protective of those who bring light into your darkened life.
