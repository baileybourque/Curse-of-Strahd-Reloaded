_An adventure for five 6th-level characters._

In this arc, after receiving an invitation to dine with Strahd on Neyavr 14—the last night before the new moon—the players journey east to Castle Ravenloft. Along the way, they might re-encounter Arrigal, who directs them to locate a traitor in Strahd's court; Father Donavich and the **vampire spawn** Doru, who have journeyed to Vallaki to seek Doru's betrothed, Gertruda; and the skeletal rider, which can lead the players to a mysterious locket hidden away in the Svalich Woods.

Upon reaching the castle crossroads, the players are met by Strahd's black carriage, which carries gifts and can escort them to the keep. At the castle, the players are met by Rahadin and Strahd's third favored bride, Anastrasya Karelova, as well as Strahd's additional vampiric consorts: Escher (Strahd's most recent consort) and Sasha Ivliskova (Strahd's eldest bride, and the traitor Arrigal referred to).

As they partake in the festivities, the players must investigate Sasha's true loyalties while avoiding conflicts with Strahd's other brides. After dining with Strahd himself, the players have an opportunity to interrogate Sasha regarding the castle's secrets—and learn that Strahd will be away from Castle Ravenloft the very next night.

Following a tour of the castle and a test of the players' capacity for violence, a freak lightning strike disables the castle drawbridge, forcing the players to stay in Castle Ravenloft overnight in the middle of a powerful storm. After ascending to their room, however, the ghost of Varushka, a former servant of Castle Ravenloft, spirits the players away to a multi-layered nightmare, forcing them to confront Castle Ravenloft's bloody past—or never wake again . . . 
# O1. The Invitation
At dusk on the night immediately after the full moon, Strahd—using information gleaned from his spies and a location assessed from his *scrying* spell—sends Rahadin, his chamberlain, to deliver them a letter.

> [!info]+ **When Does the Invitation Arrive?**
> Strahd sends the invitation on the night immediately after the full moon or as described in [[Arc D - St. Andral's Feast#D6a. The Invitation|Arc D - St. Andral's Feast]], whichever happens first.

Rahadin, riding his _phantom steed_—an ash-gray horse with dull, shadowed eyes—makes the journey to Vallaki in a little over an hour. Whether Lady Wachter or the Baron rules in Vallaki, the guards at the gates are too terrified to bar entry to Strahd’s chamberlain and herald. 

Rahadin then makes his way to the players’ current location before dismounting from his horse and entering. If the players are in the Blue Water Inn, the entire taproom falls silent upon his entrance.

When the players first see Rahadin, read:

<div class="description">
<p>You see a tall, lithe man of dusky complexion, with long, black hair that falls past his neck. A light cloak is draped across his shoulders, its edge rimmed with thick, white fur, and gloves of supple black leather cover his hands. A deep blue tunic trimmed with bronze is visible beneath a layer of tough, yet flexible leather armor, and a curved saber hangs from a sheath at his belt, with a pair of scimitars strapped to his back above it.</p>
<p>His ears taper sharply upward to elven points, and his dark, brown eyes bear a quiet awareness and a casual, almost predatory gaze as they shift slowly across his surroundings. A long, wicked scar cuts across his forehead, just above where lines have begun to mark his face with age, and his lips are pulled back into a thin, perpetual frown.</p>
</div>

As Rahadin approaches the players (or vice—versa), the players can hear the sounds of his ***screams of the dead.*** Read:

<div class="description">
<p>It begins with a dull roar—a prickle at the edge of your awareness, like the washing of the ocean against the shore. As the man grows closer, however, the muffled sound grows ever—more insistent, amplifying and building upon itself—until it resolves from a more innocuous sound, almost like waves, into a torrent of screams.</p>
<p>Your ears fill with a cacophony of a thousand voices, pleading, suffering, dying: a psychic onslaught that crashes against your mind from every direction, leaving little room for thought. The man, however, remains unflinching—seemingly undisturbed by the symphony of screams that surrounds him.</p>
</div>

The players can notice that any other Barovians within ten feet of Rahadin appear to be similarly disturbed. (Any Barovians beyond the ten—foot radius can’t hear the screams.) When Rahadin speaks, the screams somewhat recede—enough to allow him and others to be heard—but gain a notable accent of fear.

Rahadin greets the players and informs them that he has come to deliver them an invitation from his “master." He then retrieves an envelope sealed with crimson wax and bearing the Von Zarovich crest: a raven with its wings spread across a tall shield wrapped with a banner and bearing the image of a castle at its peak.

If opened, the envelope reads as follows, beginning with a list of the players' names and filling in the blank with the number of days until the night before the next new moon. (Due to Barovia's shortened lunar calendar, the next new moon takes place seven days after the players' first full moon in Barovia.)

<div class="description">
<p>To [Player Names],</p> 
<p>I have heard tell of your recent exploits in my domain, and wish to better know those who have arrived in my beloved land of Barovia. As such, I bid you dine at my castle so that we may meet in civilized surroundings.</p>
<p>I expect your attendance at dusk on the night of the moon's last light, in ___ days' time. Your passage to and from my home will be a safe one, and you shall be honored guests for as long as you remain at Castle Ravenloft.</p>
<p>My carriage shall meet you at the crossroads of Ravenloft, beyond the western gate. I await your arrival.</p>
<p>Your host,<br>
Strahd von Zarovich</p>
</div>

Rahadin declines to depart until the players have read Strahd’s invitation and confirmed their attendance. If the players accept Strahd’s invitation, Rahadin inclines his head and notes that he will expect them at Castle Ravenloft promptly at dusk on the noted date.

If the players ask or appear to be concerned as to whether Strahd truly means not to harm them, Rahadin coldly notes that Strahd is lord of the land, and his word of safe passage to and from the dinner is binding on both others and himself. “He has promised you guestright," Rahadin notes, glaring. “Do not presume to spit upon his honor or authority."

If the players ask or appear to be concerned whether Ireena would be safe at the castle, Rahadin coldly notes that both the players and Ireena would be welcome guests and protected under guestright, so long as they have not committed any offense against Strahd personally—which, to Rahadin’s knowledge, neither Ireena nor the players have done. If the players appear doubtful, Rahadin notes coolly, “Had my master sought to take Lady Kolyana from you, he could have done so as it pleased him, without your permission. She is, of course, not obliged to attend—but I advise you not to question the strength of his word."

If the players ask to delay their response, Rahadin coolly notes that his “master" expects an answer upon his return. 

If the players refuse Strahd’s invitation or continue to insist upon delaying their response, Rahadin quietly, without touching his scimitars or raising his voice above a whisper, asks them if they think it wise to insult the lord of Castle Ravenloft. “It is no threat, I assure you," he promises if challenged. “Consider it . . . cordial advice."

If the players again refuse the invitation or continue to stall, Rahadin shakes his head in disappointment. He notes that he had warned “his master" of his suspicion that the players would be “difficult, impolite, and undesirable guests," and shares that he will take no pleasure in informing his master that he was correct. 

If the players make no move to stop him, Rahadin then moves toward the door, pauses, and quietly notes that, despite his own misgivings, he would not be surprised if his master holds open the invitation regardless, should the players change their minds. He then departs.

> [!abstract]+ **Ezmerelda’s Advice**
> If told of Strahd’s invitation once recruited to their cause in [[Arc K - The Fallen Abbey]], Ezmerelda d’Avenir eagerly advises the players to accept it—if they haven’t already—as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to scope out the castle before retrieving the *Icon of Dawn's Grace* in [[Arc K - The Fallen Abbey]], rescuing the **werewolf** Emil Toranescu in [[Arc L - The Den of Wolves]], and/or recovering Argynvost’s skull in [[Arc M - The Dragon's Manor]].
>
> Ezmerelda notes, however, that she has *not* been invited to the dinner, and therefore can’t attend openly. She’s willing, though, to pursue her own independent course of action while the players dine with Strahd. At the players’ suggestion, she might spend the evening guarding Ireena, secretly surveying the castle grounds for alternate entrances and possible guards (though she won’t enter the castle itself alone), or taking some other action to further the party’s interests.

# O2. Arrigal’s Insight
One day before the dinner is scheduled to take place, if the players rescued Arabelle in [[Arc E - The Missing Vistana]], Arrigal of <span class="citation">N9. Vistani Camp (p. 119)</span> finds the players at or shortly after nightfall. (If the players spend the night away from Vallaki, Arrigal instead finds them as they pass through or around Vallaki when traveling to Castle Ravenloft the following day.)

Upon encountering the party, Arrigal—recognizable, though wearing a heavy cloak and hood to disguise his features from onlookers—"accidentally" bumps into one of the players, preferring a target with a higher passive Wisdom (Perception) score. A player with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 14 or greater notices the sensation of something slipping into their pocket during the brief moment of contact.

Without acknowledging their familiarity, Arrigal then snarls at the player to “watch where they’re going" before swiftly departing. Determined to avoid Strahd’s wrath for his betrayal, Arrigal makes every effort to dismiss the players if they attempt to follow him or otherwise interact with him further.

A player who checks their pocket finds a small, scribbled note. (A player who fails to notice Arrigal’s sleight of hand automatically finds the note the next time they take a short or long rest.) The note reads as follows:
<div class="description">
<p>Spy in castle. Seeks a meeting to discuss an opportunity. Find the victim amidst the court.</p>
<p>Burn this.</p>
<p>—A</p>
</div>

![[Spy Note.png]]
<span class="credit">"Arrigal's Note" by Caleb Cleveland. Support him on <a href="https://patreon.com/calebisdrawing/">Patreon!</a></span>


If Ezmerelda learns of the note, she excitedly advises the players to use the dinner at Castle Ravenloft as an opportunity to subtly squirrel out the traitor’s identity—and coordinate a meeting if possible.

> [!lore]+ **What Arrigal Knows**
> While making a regular report to Anastrasya at Castle Ravenloft, Arrigal attempted to eavesdrop on a conversation she was having with Strahd in private. As he did, he encountered a female vampire spawn whose face was concealed behind a veil. 
>
> Before the two parted ways, Arrigal asked whether the vampire intended to turn him in. In response, the spawn laughed quietly, and assured him that not all spawn of Strahd serve him faithfully. “Your indiscretion," she promised, “is safe with me."
>
> Arrigal doesn’t know the names or descriptions of any vampiric brides other than Anastrasya. Unbeknownst to him, the traitor is Sasha Ivliskova, his first vampiric bride. See below for more information about Sasha.

# O3. The Old Svalich Road
## O3a. Doru & Donavich
As the players move to depart Vallaki for Castle Ravenloft on the day of the dinner, if they previously spared the **vampire spawn** Doru and aided him in overcoming his thirst for blood in [[Act I - Into the Mists/Arc B - Welcome to Barovia]], they encounter Doru and his father, the priest Donavich (using the statistics of an **acolyte**) at Vallaki’s eastern Morning Gate as they approach the Old Svalich Road. Read:

<div class="description">
<p>As the closed eastern gate comes into view, you spot two guards speaking heatedly with a pair of cloaked figures through the bars of the gate. As one of the guards shifts her weight to brandish the spear at her side, you recognize the two figures on the opposite side of the gate: the Barovian priest, Father Donavich, and his son, Doru.</p>
</div>

If the players parted ways with him on good terms, Doru swiftly notices the players and waves excitedly, even as an unaware Father Donavich continues quietly negotiating with the guards before him.

If the players make themselves known and previously assisted Lady Wachter in [[Arc F - Lady Wachter's Wish]] or [[Arc H - The Lost Soul]], the guards at the gate recognize them by their appearance and greet them with respect. The guards, who are named Gorek and Drilvia, are mistrustful of and annoyed with Doru and Donavich, and can share the following information:

* The two men, who introduced themselves as Doru and Father Donavich, arrived outside the gates last night and “demanded" entry. (If able to hear this characterization, Doru rolls his eyes in obvious irritation.) 
* Because of his red-tinted eyes and pointed ears, both Gorek and Drilvia and the previous shift’s guards believe Doru to be a vampire (which he and Donavich deny) and have therefore refused him entry. (If asked, they can explain uncomfortably that, while Vallaki officially recognizes the Devil as lord of Barovia, Lady Wachter has maintained Baron Vallakovich’s policy of barring entry to any undead—so long as those undead aren’t approved by the Devil himself.)
* The guards of both shifts have repeatedly offered Father Donavich an opportunity to enter the gates himself, so long as Doru remains outside. However, Donavich has refused to enter without Doru, and both spent the night sleeping on the road as a result.

A player with a passive Wisdom (Insight) of 14 or greater notices that Gorek appears somewhat uncertain about barring Doru entry. A player who points this out to him and succeeds on a DC 14 Charisma (Persuasion) check can convince him to share his uncertain belief that, because Doru doesn’t seem to have any fangs, he might not be undead at all.

If they parted ways with the players on good terms, Doru (whose fangs are concealed due to his control of his bloodlust) and Donavich greet the players with warmth and relief. Doru and Donavich then ask the players for their assistance in gaining entry to the town. They can share the following information if asked:

* After the players departed the village of Barovia, Doru and Donavich reconciled and worked to repair the worst of the damage inflicted upon the Barovian church. The two have worked hard together in sessions of “meditation and prayer," and Donavich is proud of Doru’s “progress."
* After completing the church’s repairs and learning of Gertruda’s disappearance, Doru was anxious to try to find her. Determined to help his son and future daughter-in-law, Donavich ensured that the village had no further need of his healing services before setting off with Doru on the road to Vallaki, hoping to find Gertruda—or at least clues to her whereabouts or ultimate fate.
* The two spent the night at Tser Pool encampment two nights ago, then set off for Vallaki yesterday morning, arriving at Vallaki just before dusk. (If the players imply that Doru or Donavich had reason to fear the monsters of the Svalich Wood in making the trek, Doru smiles coldly and says, “I’d like to see them try.") Although Doru has repeatedly insisted that his father go ahead and find shelter, Donavich has stubbornly refused to leave Doru behind.

> [!warning]+ **Changing Canon**
> A previous version of this guide informed the players that Gertruda traveled to Castle Ravenloft, rather than Vallaki. To adapt this scene accordingly, have Doru instead inform the players that he is visiting Vallaki in the hopes of obtaining spiritual guidance from Father Lucian Petrovich, who Donavich has assured him is a wise and learned priest.

The players can convince Gorek and Drilvia to allow Donavich and Doru entry by vouching for Doru’s self-control and succeeding on a DC 14 Charisma (Persuasion or Intimidation) check. Alternatively, the players can convince Gorek and Drilvia that Doru isn’t a vampire by making a convincing argument—for example, that he’s an elf with an ocular condition—and succeeding on a DC 11 Charisma (Deception) check, made with advantage if the players have encouraged Gorek to trust his doubts.

If the players aid them in securing entry to Vallaki, Doru and Donavich are deeply grateful for their assistance, as well as any directions the players can provide to the nearest inn.
## O3b. The Rider’s Guidance
The journey from Vallaki to <span class="citation">I. Black Carriage (p. 37)</span> is eight and one-quarter miles long and takes two hours and forty-five minutes.

Approximately one-quarter mile and five minutes before the players reach the western <span class="citation">B. Gates of Barovia (p. 33)</span>, if they didn’t kill the <span class="citation">Skeletal Rider (p. 31)</span> in [[Act I - Into the Mists/Arc C - Into the Valley]], they encounter it once again. Read:

<div class="description">
<p>The Old Svalich Road takes you eastward, briefly touching the southern shore of Lake Zarovich before bending around a craggy mountain spur. Not long after departing the promontory where the old windmill stands, the road plunges back into a dark, gloomy wood cloistered between two mountain peaks.</p>
<p>The air here is cold and quiet, and the damp gravel of the road occasionally crunches underfoot. Your ears catch the snap of a twig in the underbrush—and through the mist steps a familiar skeletal warhorse and rider. The skeletal rider sits silently, its lightless lantern held aloft in one bony hand.</p>
</div>

If the players move to pass it or otherwise disregard its appearance, the rider raises its free hand and beckons for them to follow it. If the players approach or follow it, it turns and beckons them into the mist, away from the road.

The rider will answer up to three questions through simple nods or shakes of its head before again beckoning the players forward, though its demeanor indicates an obvious impatience to continue the task at hand. If it doesn’t know or isn’t willing to answer a question, it simply remains silent. It can provide the following information if asked the right questions:

* It means no harm to the players, and is not leading them into danger.
* It was not sent by Strahd, nor is it loyal to him.
* It was sent by someone who is no friend to Strahd. (The rider won’t disclose this person’s identity.)

If the players follow it, read:

<div class="description">
<p>The rider leads you silently a short distance northwest through the woods, its steed’s hooves rustling softly through the rotted leaves. The rider never looks back to meet your gaze, instead keeping its dark sockets directed firmly at the forest ahead.</p>
<p>The wooded terrain slopes upward here, the loamy sod giving way to scattered boulders as the basin slowly becomes a mountain crag. The rider guides you to a small rocky outcropping overlooking the nearby woods, upon which stands a tall, ancient oak tree. Its dark leaves rustle restlessly in the chill wind, and black vines spread across its wizened bark like old veins.</p>
</div>

Once it has led the players to the tree, the rider gives them a silent nod and departs, gesturing for the players to remain behind if they move to follow it.

Players who explore or otherwise linger near the tree notice a small wooden carving set into the trunk of the tree near chest height. If the players inspect the carving, read:

<div class="description">
<p>Two letters connected by an ampersand appear to have been carved into the tree trunk, reading: “K & V." A small, dark hollow filled with crumbled leaves lies in the trunk just above it. There seems to be something lying amidst the leaves.</p>
</div>

The object in the hollow is a small, ancient scroll of parchment, tied delicately with mud-stained string. If opened, the parchment reads as follows in hastily-scrawled ink:

<div class="description">
<p>Dearest Varushka,</p>
<p>I hope this letter finds you well, though I fear it may not. My heart aches as I pen these words, knowing they may be the last I ever write you.</p>
<p>I pray that you too survived the slaughter. Please forgive my cowardice—though I fled for my life, some part of me also knew I had fled from the life we may once have shared together. If you are reading this letter, then my spirit is gladdened to know that you have also escaped safely. My heart breaks, however, to share that we shall never again meet in this life.</p>
<p>I have been given—and accepted—an offer of a new future, and a new opportunity. I do this not to abandon you, but because I am convinced that there is no other way to set things right. You always said that nothing is ever too broken to repair. As I stand at this crossroads, I cling to my hope that you were right.</p>
<p>Some time ago, you gave me a gift—one that I cannot take with me on this new journey. I have left it atop our tree, watched by a pair of guardians provided by my new benefactor. Please take it with my deepest regrets and my warmest wishes. No soul deserves love and peace more than you.</p>
<p>May you live a long and happy life, and may joy follow evermore in your footsteps, even in the nights of darkest sorrow.</p>
<p>Sincerely and forever yours,</p>
<p>Katarina</p>
</div>

The oak tree is one hundred feet tall and six feet in diameter, with sparse, thick branches toward its base and denser, thinner branches toward its top. No check is required to climb the tree.

If a player climbs to the top of the tree, read:

<div class="description">
<p>Your head pops through the leaves of the tree’s upper canopy, briefly escaping the thick, dreary mist that swallows the landscape below. A few yards away, an old bird’s nest sits perched amongst the branches. You catch the glint of something metallic from inside the nest.</p>
</div>

A player who approaches or otherwise moves to interact with the nest is obstructed by two old **ravens**, who squawk angrily at the player in warning. If the player ignores or attempts to push past the ravens, the birds peck fiercely at the player’s fingers, forcing them to succeed on a DC 10 Strength saving throw or fall from their current perch. Upon falling, the player must succeed on an additional DC 10 Dexterity saving throw to catch themselves upon a lower branch or plummet one hundred feet to the ground on a failure.

The ravens are faithful servants of the Seeker and the descendants of the ravens once set to guard this tree. The players can convince them to stand aside by stating their intent to deliver the item to Varushka or otherwise honor Katarina’s memory and succeeding on a DC 5 Charisma (Persuasion) check. The ravens can’t be deceived or intimidated, and fight to the death if attacked.

> [!abstract]+ **Speaking with the Ravens**
> A player who uses *speak with animals* or similar magic to communicate with the ravens can convince them to share their mission with a successful DC 12 Charisma (Persuasion) check. On a success, the ravens share that they are the descendants of ravens set to guard this place long ago, a duty they consider "the highest honor." If asked who ordered them to guard this tree, the ravens proudly declare that they serve the memory of "She Who Seeks in Storm-Clouds." (This is the name by which the ravens know the Seeker.)

The object in the nest is a small, old wooden box with a tarnished silver latch bearing centuries of scratches and scrapes from ravens’ claws. If opened, the box contains half of a two-piece locket necklace made of tarnished silver.

> [!lore]+ **Katarina’s Legacy**
> Katarina—Madam Eva’s alter ego—and her fellow servant Varushka often came to this outcropping together on free days when they served together in Castle Ravenloft. When she fled Strahd’s rampage on the day of his transformation into a vampire, Katarina came to this location first, hoping in vain that Varushka would meet her. It was here that Katarina first made her pact with the Seeker to become Madam Eva in exchange for an opportunity to one day put Strahd to rest and restore the sun to Barovia once more.
## O3c. The Black Carriage
After passing through the western <span class="citation">B. Gates of Barovia (p. 33)</span>, the players arrive at the crossroads leading to Castle Ravenloft. Strahd’s black carriage is now present, and is as described in <span class="citation">I. Black Carriage (p. 37)</span>.

As the players approach or move to pass the carriage, they notice a small parchment scroll tied to the inside handle of the carriage door. The scroll, which is tied with a blood-red ribbon and sealed with the familiar wax sigil of Castle Ravenloft, is written in Strahd’s handwriting and reads as follows:

<div class="description">
<p>It is customary for a lord to provide safe escort and a gift to guests in his home. Please accept both with my sincerest compliments.</p>
</div>

A finely carved wooden chest has been wrapped in a bright red ribbon and left upon one of the cushioned seats inside the carriage. The chest, which is locked and approximately one foot across and six inches deep, radiates an aura of conjuration magic under the scrutiny of a *detect magic* spell. The chest has the properties of a *bag of holding*, but only if opened in the correct way. (Despite its rigid appearance, if opened correctly, the box's mouth expands to fit any item placed inside of it, so long as that item fits within the box's internal volume. The box shrinks back to its original size once the item is fully within the box.)

> [!abstract]+ **Storing the Skull**
> Should the players use it to do so, the extradimensional space within the chest is large enough to store the skull of the silver dragon Argynvost in [[Arc P - Ravenloft Heist#Hall of Bones|Arc P - Ravenloft Heist]].

The front of the chest bears a carved sliding puzzle composed of eight slidable wooden panels and a ninth empty space in the center of the puzzle. Each panel is carved with a different animal. When the players first inspect it, the rows of the puzzle read as follows from top to bottom: bat, rat, elk; wolf, empty space, bear; spider, raven, butterfly.

The following poem is carved upon the top of the chest in beautiful calligraphy:

<div class="description" style="text-align: center;">
<p>My lips I nightly lift toward the silver moon,<br>
With trembling strings I weave upon my tiny loom,<br>
On wings of ink I glide above the sulking gloom.</p>
<p>Scuttling through the shadows, in darkness I confide,<br>
With daylight's fragile beauty upon my lying eyes,<br>
Silent in the cavern's womb, with naught but stars to guide.</p>
<p>I seek majesty in solitude,<br>
I have no truths to hide,<br>
My crown yet sits upon my head for all to see with pride.</p>
</div>

The poem is a hint as to the proper order of the panels: wolf, spider, raven; rat, butterfly, bat; bear, empty space, elk. If the panels are arranged in the proper order, the chest opens, allowing access to the extradimensional storage space within. When first opened in this way, the chest contains a number of neatly wrapped parcels equal to the number of players. Each parcel contains a set of fine black velvet gloves with silver trim and a fine black velvet cloak lined with wolf fur.

The players can also open the chest by picking the lock and succeeding on a DC 20 Dexterity (Thieves’ Tools) check, or by forcing the chest open and succeeding on a DC 15 Strength check. If the players open the chest in this way, it has an ordinary interior and contains only a bottle of Red Dragon Crush wine, stamped with the name of the Wizard of Wines. If the players force open the chest, the bottle shatters and breaks, staining any nearby fingers and boots a faint, but noticeable shade of red.
# O4. Arrival at Castle Ravenloft
The journey from <span class="citation">I. Black Carriage (p. 37)</span> to Castle Ravenloft is two-and-a-half miles long and takes fifty minutes to walk or forty minutes by carriage. 

The gates of Ravenloft are largely as described in <span class="citation">J. Gates of Ravenloft (p. 38)</span>. However, revise the area’s description to read as follows:

<div class="description">
<p>After winding through the forest and craggy mountain peaks, the road takes a sudden turn to the east, and the startling, awesome presence of Castle Ravenloft towers before you. The carriage comes to a dead stop before twin turrets of stone, broken from years of exposure. Beyond these guard towers is the precipice of a fifty-foot-wide, fog-filled chasm that disappears into unknown depths.</p>
<p>An imposing drawbridge of old, shored-up wooden beams looms high above the chasm, suspended by chains of thick, rust-eaten iron that creak and strain under the weight. From atop the high walls, stone gargoyles stare at you out of their hollow eye sockets and grin hideously.</p>
<p>A deep, resonant grinding echoes through the air as unseen mechanisms suddenly groan to life. The chains above shudder and shriek as the drawbridge descends with a deliberate, inexorable pace. With a heavy, final thud, it comes to rest across the chasm.</p>
</div>

Once the drawbridge has descended, the carriage resumes its passage toward the castle. Read:

<div class="description">
<p>The carriage lurches forward, its wheels creaking as it rolls onto the drawbridge. The wooden planks groan beneath its weight, each hoofbeat striking a somber drumbeat against the ancient structure. You catch a final glimpse of the gargoyles atop the walls, their stony grins resembling leers amidst the shadows of the keep.</p>
<p>A rotting wooden portcullis, green with growth, hangs above the entry tunnel. As the horses pass beneath it, the carriage’s lanterns cast flickering shadows against the dark stone walls, forming strange, twisted shapes that cling to the mortared brickwork.</p>
<p>The carriage emerges from the tunnel into a courtyard, where it shudders to a halt. The carriage door clicks—and slowly opens.</p>
</div>

The players have arrived at Castle Ravenloft.
## O4a. The Courtyard
<span class="citation"><em>This scene takes place in Chapter 4, Area K1.</em></span>

> Thick, cold fog swirls in this courtyard. Sporadic flashes of lightning lance the weeping clouds overhead as thunder shakes the ground. Through the drizzle, you see torch flames fluttering on each side of the keep’s open main doors. Warm light spills out of the entrance, flooding the courtyard. High above the entrance is a round window with shards of broken glass lodged in its iron frame.

Neither the drawbridge nor the portcullis will move until both latches are activated.

This area is largely as described in <span class="citation">K1. Front Courtyard (p. 52)</span>. However, as the players exit the carriage, revise this area’s description as follows:

<div class="description">
<p>Thick, cold fog swirls in this courtyard, and sporadic flashes of lightning lance the weeping clouds overhead as thunder shakes the ground. Through the drizzle, you see torch flames fluttering on each side of the keep's tall main doors. High above the entrance is a round window with shards of broken glass lodged in its iron frame.</p>
<p>The castle doors stand open, warm light spilling out of the entrance and flooding the courtyard. Two figures stand between the doors. One, a tall, lithe man with pointed ears and a dusky complexion, wears a rich, blue tunic set with intricate spiral patterns and trimmed with golden thread. His lip is curled in a thin, perpetual frown, and he holds both hands primly clasped behind his back.</p>
<p>His companion, a woman, wears a striking red dress with a layered, ruffled frill. A black and crimson silk head scarf wraps around her head, its lush fabric sewn with precious jewels, and a black opal pendant glints from a silver necklace dangling loosely from her neck. Her red eyes glint in the flickering light, and you catch a glimpse of a gleaming-white fang behind her curved upper lip.</p>
</div>

The players recognize the man as Rahadin, Strahd’s chamberlain. The woman is Anastrasya Karelova, one of Strahd’s vampiric brides.

> [!profile]+ **Profile: Anastrasya Karelova**

> ***Emotions.*** Anastrasya most often feels calm, amused, satisfied, or intrigued.
>
> ***Motivations.*** Anastrasya wants to remove Volenta, Ludmilla, and the players as competitors to Strahd’s affections—by setting them against each other, if at all possible.

Anastrasya greets the players warmly by name (“You must be . . . “), then welcomes them to Castle Ravenloft. As she does, she expresses her cheerful delight at finally having an opportunity to meet them in person and shares that she’s “heard *so* much about them."

If the players inquire as to Strahd’s absence, Rahadin notes flatly that “the master is occupied with other business," and will see to the players soon. 

If any players appear slovenly, dirty (e.g., due to spilling the wine from Strahd’s *box of holding*), or poorly dressed, Rahadin curls his lip and asks, in evident disbelief, whether they truly consider themselves presentable. “You are about to dine with the lord of Castle Ravenloft," he intones, glaring at them. “A certain . . . decorum is expected for those who wish to show *respect.*" If any players are wearing the cloaks from Strahd’s *box of holding* or otherwise took additional effort to make a good impression, Rahadin briefly inspects their clothing before declaring their appearance “adequate."

> [!abstract]+ **Holy Symbol of Ravenkind**
> If Anastrasya notices any player wearing the _Holy Symbol of Ravenkind_, she singles them out and, while fussing over their clothing, pointedly adjusts its weight around the player's neck. As she does, she compliments the player on their "lovely jewelry," but wonders aloud whether it "might be overdecorated." She adds, "Some might call it tacky, but darling, I love a guest who can wear such a piece with such _confidence_."
> 
> A player with a passive Wisdom (Insight) score of 16 or greater notices that, when observing the _Holy Symbol_, Anastrasya's voice is tight, her lips slightly curled, and her eyes bear a faint glint of furious recognition. If confronted regarding her apparent recognition, Anastrasya laughs delightedly and claims the symbol "somewhat resembles an item an _old friend_ of hers once wore, quite a long time ago." (Anastrasya is referring to the paladin Lugdana, who hunted Anastrasya down and drove her into hiding nearly a century ago.)

After Anastrasya fusses over the players’ clothes and ushers them into <span class="citation">K7. Entry (p. 54)</span> and out of the rain, Rahadin turns, nods, and clicks his tongue toward the carriage. The horses then trot away, leading the carriage through the northern <span class="citation">K2. Center Court Gate (p. 54)</span> and into <span class="citation">K3. Servants’ Courtyard (p. 54)</span>, where they are greeted and led into <span class="citation">K4. Carriage House (p. 54)</span> by the **mongrelfolk** Cyrus Belview. (See <span class="citation">K62. Servants’ Hall (p. 76)</span> for more information about Cyrus.)

As the players enter the keep, the castle drawbridge rises once more. Read:

<div class="description">
<p>A low rumbling cuts through the rain. In the distance, you see the massive chains of the drawbridge tense, their links clanking against one another as the mechanism awakens once more. Slowly, like a stirring giant, the drawbridge rises into the night, leaving the fog-choked chasm behind. With a shuddering thud, it settles into place, the torchlight flickering across its wooden beams and rusted iron bolts once more.</p>

The dragons don’t attack characters who enter this area from [area K1](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/cos/castle-ravenloft#K1FrontCourtyard "area K1"), heading east. The dragons are four [red dragon wyrmlings](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16993-red-dragon-wyrmling), and they have instructions to allow guests to enter the castle, but not to leave it. If intruders vacate this area, the dragons fly up to their perches and revert to stone. In their stone forms, they are impervious to weapon damage. The dragons never leave the room.
> 


The castle foyer is largely as described in <span class="citation">K7. Entry (p. 54)</span>. However, decrease the number of **dragon wyrmling** statues to two. (The other two are harmless statuary.) The dragon statues do not attack the players for as long as the players are here by invitation.

In addition, revise this area’s description as follows as Rahadin leads the players through for the first time:

<div class="description">
<p>You pass through the ornate outer doors into the castle's vaulted entry foyer, your footsteps echoing on the dark stone floor. Overhead, four statues of dragons glare down, their lifelike eyes flickering in the torchlight.</p>
<p>Twenty feet inside the castle is a second set of doors, manned by two figures. To the left stands a handsome young man with long, blond hair, his soft features sharpened by a frozen smile. To the right, a pale-skinned woman in an old wedding gown stands stiffly. Her hair, as black as a raven’s feathers, cascades over her shoulders, and her lips are pulled daintily back to reveal two, fine-pointed fangs. As you approach, both bow deeply to Rahadin—the man with a cat’s mocking grace, the woman with a jerking, guarded motion—and step aside to pull open the doors for your passage.</p>
</div>

The players recognize the man as Escher, Strahd’s **vampire spawn** consort, who they previously met in [[Act I - Into the Mists/Arc C - Into the Valley]]. The woman is Sasha Ivliskova, a **vampire spawn** and Strahd’s eldest vampiric bride.

> [!profile]+ **Profile: Escher**
> **Roleplaying Information**
> ***Resonance.*** Escher should make the players feel amused and flattered with his flamboyantly flirtatious behavior, irritated with his snide or condescending commentary, and, eventually, sympathetic to his unspoken guilt for his role in bringing harm to his friends and neighbors by awakening Strahd.
> 
> ***Emotions.*** Escher most often feels annoyed, curious, angry, smug, anxious, fearful, playful, mischievous, amused, guilty, bitter, regretful, or ashamed.
> 
> ***Motivations.*** Escher wants to please Strahd and avoid falling from his favor.
> 
> ***Inspirations.*** When roleplaying Escher, channel Astarion (*Baldur's Gate 3*), Crowley (*Good Omens*), and Renly Baratheon (*Game of Thrones*).
> 
> **Character Information**
> ***Persona.*** To the world, Escher is a flamboyant and self-assured member of Strahd's court, with a love for preening, luxuries, and attention. Only Escher knows that he is a guilt-ridden, self-loathing, broken man who longs desperately for Strahd's approval and has long since resigned himself to the cage his choices have trapped him in.
> 
> ***Morale.*** In a fight, Escher would seek to entreat or flee his adversary, fighting only if cornered or if grievously offended.
> 
> ***Relationships.*** Before becoming one of Strahd's consorts, Escher had a crush on Doru, his former best friend. He is now one of Strahd's consorts—though not formally wed to him—and an inferior member of Strahd's court.

> [!profile]+ **Profile: Sasha Ivliskova**
> **Roleplaying Information**
> ***Resonance.*** Sasha should make the players feel sympathetic toward her clear discomfort as one of Strahd's brides, endeared to her for her efforts to maintain her dignity in the face of dismissal and cruelty from Strahd's other brides, and mildly put off by her standoffish reluctance to allow others to get close to her.
> 
> ***Emotions.*** Sasha most often feels melancholy, anxious, despondent, uncomfortable, anguished, reluctant, or fearful. If treated with kindness, she might feel grateful or hopeful.
> 
> ***Motivations.*** Sasha is motivated by her desire to avoid Strahd's wrath, protect other vulnerable Barovians from falling under Strahd's thrall, and free herself from the vampiric curse of undeath.
> 
> ***Inspirations.*** When roleplaying Sasha, channel Sansa Stark (*Game of Thrones)*), Katniss Everdeen (*The Hunger Games*), and Elsa (*Frozen*).
> 
> **Character Information**
> ***Persona.*** To the world, Sasha is a quiet, brooding vampire with little interest in others. To those she trusts, Sasha is a sorrowful, guilt-ridden soul desperate to escape her monstrous existence.
> 
> ***Morale.*** In a fight, Sasha would seek to flee or entreat her adversary, fighting only if cornered by an evil or malevolent opponent.
> 
> ***Relationships.*** Sasha is Strahd's first bride and a secret friend to Gertruda, Doru's betrothed and Strahd's prisoner.

> [!lore]+ **The Eldest Bride**
> Nearly four hundred years ago, in his grief after losing Tatyana, Strahd lured several more women to Castle Ravenloft as described in <span class="citation">Rahadin (p. 236)</span>. All perished to his newfound thirst for blood—but only Sasha Ivliskova, whom Strahd found remarkably similar in temperament to Tatyana, retained his interest for long.
>
> In a wedding ceremony attended by the terrified burgomasters and other nobles of Barovia, Strahd made Sasha a **vampire spawn**—and his first vampiric bride. Their union, however, was not a happy one. Embittered and disappointed by his loss of Tatyana, Strahd often raged at Sasha’s “inadequacy," cursing her and treating her cruelly for her many perceived shortcomings. Terrified, but unwilling to accept his abuse any longer, Sasha demanded her freedom—and Strahd punished her by imprisoning her in a tiny crypt in Ravenloft’s catacombs.
>
> Sasha remained in her crypt for centuries, descending into madness as the long years starved her of both blood and companionship. Compelled by Strahd’s orders to remain, she was powerless to even touch the heavy slab that sealed her silent tomb, its smooth stone surface mere inches from her shriveled, trembling hands.
>
> It was only when Strahd awoke from his recent hibernation that he finally retrieved Sasha from her prison, allowing her eyes to see light for the first time in nearly four centuries. Driven into a frenzy by the three Barovian prisoners he left for her, she descended upon them like an animal, her mind returning only once she’d drunk their final drop of blood.
>
> Sasha hates what she has become—and the only thing she hates more than that is Strahd. Though she isn’t sure why he awoke her, she desires nothing less than his complete and utter end—and her own opportunity to finally find rest at last.

If Ireena is with the party, Sasha briefly startles upon glimpsing her—almost as though “she’s seen a ghost"—but swiftly regains her composure.

> [!lore]+ **Sasha & Tatyana**
> Although Sasha and Tatyana never met in life, Sasha is deeply familiar with Tatyana’s face, having spent many years studying the other woman’s features in the commissioned portrait Strahd placed in <span class="citation">K37. Study (p. 66)</span>. Although Sasha once hated Tatyana for escaping Strahd’s clutches, age has matured her loathing to pity, and Sasha now mourns Tatyana as a woman not unlike herself: a victim of Strahd’s appetites and cruelty.
>
> Though she isn’t sure whether she believes it herself, Sasha knows that Strahd believes Ireena is Tatyana reincarnated—a fact he used to idly mock her shortly after her emergence from her tomb. Though she is powerless to disobey Strahd’s will, Sasha—shocked by Ireena’s resemblance to Tatyana—prays that Ireena might avoid her counterpart’s fate, and that her soul might one day find freedom from Strahd’s dark clutches.
## O4c. The Great Entry
<span class="citation"><em>This scene takes place in Chapter 4, Area K8.</em></span>
>[!source]+ https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/cos/castle-ravenloft#K8GreatEntry
> 
> 
> Cobwebs stretch between the columns that support the vaulted ceiling of a great, dusty hall dimly lit by sputtering torches in iron sconces. The torches cast odd shadows across the faces of eight stone gargoyles squatting motionlessly on the rim of the domed ceiling. Cracked and faded ceiling frescoes are covered by decay. Double doors of bronze stand closed to the east. To the north, a wide staircase climbs into darkness. A lit hallway to the south contains another set of bronze doors, through which you hear sad and majestic organ tones.
> 
> The southern hallway is described in [area K9](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/cos/castle-ravenloft#K9GuestsHall "area K9"). The wide staircase leads up to [area K19](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/cos/castle-ravenloft#K19GrandLanding "area K19").
> 
> If the characters are here by invitation, add the following:
> 
> An elf with brown skin and long black hair descends the wide staircase, quiet as a cat. He wears a gray cloak over black studded leather armor and has a polished scimitar hanging from his belt. “My master is expecting you,” he says.
> 
> The elf is [Rahadin](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17370-rahadin), the castle chamberlain (see [appendix D](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/cos/appendix-d-monsters-and-npcs#Rahadin "appendix D")). He fights only if attacked. Otherwise, he leads the characters to the dining hall ([area K10](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/cos/castle-ravenloft#K10DiningHall "area K10")), points them inside, pulls the doors shut behind them, and withdraws to [area K72](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/cos/castle-ravenloft#K72ChamberlainsOffice "area K72") by way of the South Tower Stair ([area K21](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/cos/castle-ravenloft#K21SouthTowerStair "area K21")).

> 
> After all the characters leave this room, the eight [gargoyles](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16868-gargoyle) attack any character who dares to return. The gargoyles also swoop down to fight if they are attacked. When the gargoyles attack, the turbulence in the air from their wings extinguishes the feeble torches in the sconces, plunging the hall into darkness unless the characters have light sources.
> 


This area is largely as described in <span class="citation">K8. Great Entry (p. 55)</span>. However, decrease the number of **gargoyles** to four. The gargoyles don’t attack so long as the players are here by invitation.

In addition, remove the description of “sad and majestic organ tones" from the final sentence of this area’s description, omit the description of Rahadin, and add the following text to the end of this area’s description, modifying it as necessary if Volenta Popofsky or Ludmilla Vilisevic have previously been killed:

<div class="description">
<p>A dainty woman, wearing a faded gold wedding gown and a platinum mask shaped like a skull, sloshes a wine glass filled with a deep, crimson liquid as she gestures wildly. Her companion, a tall, dark-skinned woman wearing a gold tiara and a simple white gown, instead disregards her, her cold gaze flickering toward you as her expression darkens. Her grip on her own wine glass tightens, and the corners of her mouth pull ever-slightly downwards.</p>
</div>

### Introductions
If they have previously encountered them in [[Arc D - St. Andral's Feast]] and [[Arc J - The Stolen Gem]], the players recognize the dainty woman as Volenta Popofsky and the tall woman as Ludmilla Vilisevic. Volenta and Ludmilla recognize the players—Ludmilla regarding them with an icy disdain, and Volenta draining her glass as she scowls at them below her mask.

Escher and Sasha then close the entry doors behind them, joining the players and other consorts in the great entry. If uninterrupted, Anastrasya attempts to introduce the players to Volenta and Ludmilla—though she adds, with an amused smile, that she “believes they may have already met." 

Anastrasya then attempts to introduce the players to Escher and Sasha, introducing them as “our Lord’s newest delight" and “our Lord’s eldest bride," respectively. “Dearest Sasha doesn’t look her years, of course," she adds, almost as an afterthought. “Why, our Lord recently told me she still looks as radiant as the first day he laid eyes on her." (A player with a passive Wisdom (Insight) of 13 or greater notices Sasha visibly tremble at Anastrasya’s backhanded “compliment," Sasha’s fingers tightening into fists as her vampiric claws draw blood from her own palms.)

> [!abstract]+ **Escher and Ireena**
> If Ireena is not present, Escher is flamboyant, cheerful, and flirtatious with the players, determined to show Strahd’s other consorts that he won’t be cowed by their efforts to pull rank. If Ireena is present, Escher, though still flamboyant, is more withdrawn and even occasionally abrasive and quick-tempered. Too ashamed of the consequences of his decision to awaken Strahd—such as the death of Ireena’s father and the deaths of many of his friends and neighbors—he is unwilling to meet her eyes for the duration of the evening.

### Volenta’s Toy
As introductions draw to a close, Rahadin moves into <span class="citation">K9. Guests' Hall (p. 56)</span> to guard the entrance to <span class="citation">K21. South Tower Stair (p. 59)</span>. As he does, a man emerges from the south tower stair and joins the players and brides in the great entry. Read:

<div class="description">
<p>A thin man dressed in fine servant’s clothes exits the torchlit staircase, his face completely obscured by a pale white mask. He holds a tray with several wine glasses and two pitchers of liquid upon it—one deep purple, one bright crimson—and steps carefully across the stone floor toward you.</p>
</div>

The man is a middle-aged Barovian villager named Anton Konstantinovich. He has no tongue and cannot speak. 

![[Anton.png]]
<span class="credit">"Anton" by Caleb Cleveland. Support him on <a href="https://patreon.com/calebisdrawing/">Patreon!</a></span>

Unless interrupted, Anton moves first to offer the players wine from the purple pitcher. (If the players ask to have their drinks poured from the red pitcher, the man silently shakes his head and again proffers the purple pitcher. The liquid in the red pitcher is blood, which the vampires drink exclusively.)

Any player for whom the man pours a drink notices that each of his fingertips have been severed to the first knuckle, and a player with a passive Wisdom (Insight) score of 13 or greater notices that his hands are trembling. A player who peers past the mask into the man’s eyes and succeeds on a DC 13 Wisdom (Insight) check notices that they are wide with fear.

> [!lore]+ **The Tongueless Man**
> Volenta kidnapped Anton and his wife, Dezdrelda Konstaninova, several weeks ago and subjected them to numerous tortures to satisfy her profane delights, including cutting Anton’s tongue out and severing the tips of his fingers.
>
> While Anton has been “permitted" to serve as an attendant to the evening’s festivities, Dezdrelda’s corpse has been strung up in <span class="citation">K63. Wine Cellar (p. 77)</span> and exsanguinated, her blood drained to feed the vampires’ appetites during the night’s festivities.

As drinks are served, Anastrasya attempts to continue the conversation, noting her keen interest in “getting to know such exotic outsiders better," and asking about their interests, hobbies, and experiences. Anastrasya does all she can to show a keen and sincere interest in the players, asking follow-up questions, laughing at their jokes, and probing deeply into their stories and anecdotes.

After serving Anastrasya and Escher glasses of “wine" from the red pitcher—Sasha refuses one of her own, shaking her head with a curt, thin frown—Anton approaches Volenta and Ludmilla and attempts to refill their glasses. As he does, read:

<div class="description">
<p>The masked man stumbles, losing his grip on the red pitcher—and a wave of crimson liquid soars through the air before splashing across Volenta’s golden gown. The other vampires abruptly fall silent as Volenta whirls toward him, her sodden dress hanging limply across her chest. Her eyes burn with frenzied rage behind her mask, and her hand tightens around her wine glass so hard it shatters.</p>
</div>

Unless prevented by the players, Volenta then whirls the jagged stem of her glass toward Anton’s throat and sweetly whispers that “poor Anton has been a bad, clumsy boy." “I can be clumsy too," she adds quietly, brushing the jagged glass gently against the edge of his throat. “Just a little slip of the hand, and—oops!"

The players can convince Volenta to spare Anton with a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check or a DC 20 Charisma (Intimidation) check, made with advantage if they invoke the possibility that Volenta might draw Strahd’s wrath by spilling blood on the castle floor. The players can also distract Volenta by finding something else to draw her attention and succeeding on a DC 15 Charisma (Performance) check or by using magic to clean her dress and succeeding on a DC 5 Charisma (Persuasion) check.

If the players indicate an interest in attacking Volenta, Rahadin swiftly moves to interpose, placing one hand on the jet-black hilt of his saber while placing the other on the aggressing player’s chest. “You are guests within these walls," he says softly, “but do not forget where you are." His eyes glint dangerously. “To violate the sanctity of guestright here is to invite . . . severe consequences."

> [!abstract]+ **Dead Volenta**
> If the players previously killed Volenta in [[Arc D - St. Andral's Feast]], Anton instead spills his wine on Ludmilla. Rather than shattering her wine glass, she instead summons a nimbus of crackling lightning around her free hand. “Perhaps Volenta broke you beyond repair," she murmurs coldly, lifting her hand toward his chest as he whimpers in fear. “I have long since grown used to cleaning up her messes." 
### The Lord of the Castle
Whether the players successfully convince or distract Volenta or not, Strahd then immediately descends from <span class="citation">K19. Grand Landing (p. 58)</span> into <span class="citation">K8. Great Entry (p. 55)</span>.

If the players successfully convinced or distracted Volenta, read:

<div class="description">
<p>The sound of light applause fills your ears.</p>
</div>

Otherwise, if the players failed to convince or distract Volenta

<div class="description">
<p>Volenta’s nostrils flare, her eyes glittering with rage. Her hand shifts, the broken glass blurring toward the man’s exposed neck—</p>
<p>A man’s stern voice, rich and resonant, cuts through the air. “You forget yourself," he intones. “There are guests in our home."</p>
<p>Volenta’s hand freezes, a hair’s breadth from slicing through flesh.</p>
</div>

In either case, continue:

<div class="description">
<p>Even, measured footsteps echo from the grand stone staircase, and a tall, elegant figure descends into view. He wears a fitted vest of rich scarlet above a crisp white shirt, each ornate fastening meticulously buttoned.</p>
<p>He moves with a cat’s grace, his long, velvet-black cloak whispering through the air behind him. As he approaches, the flickering light of the torches dances across his pale skin, his crimson eyes glinting like rubies.</p>
<p>"Good evening," Strahd von Zarovich says, his lips curling into a cordial smile.</p>
</div>

![[Strahd at Dinner.png]]
<span class="credit">"Strahd at Dinner" by Caleb Cleveland. Support him on <a href="https://patreon.com/calebisdrawing/">Patreon!</a></span>

Each vampire spawn immediately falls silent and turns to offer Strahd a deep curtsy or bow. As she curtsies, Anastrasya bows her head and closes her eyes, murmuring, “Good evening, my lord." She adds, her eyes flickering toward Volenta, “I hope the night’s revelry did not disturb your work."

After cordially dismissing Anastrasya’s concerns, Strahd greets the players, welcoming them to Castle Ravenloft and apologizing for Volenta’s behavior if necessary. (“She can be quite excitable at times," he notes crisply. “One of her most attractive qualities—and perhaps her greatest flaw.")

Strahd then briefly mourns the spilled “wine" before turning to Sasha. “My dear Sasha—would you mind retrieving a mop from Cyrus and attending to this mess?" he asks. His eyes linger on Volenta, "Two mops, perhaps, if anyone would care to assist."

If one of the players volunteers to help Sasha clean, Strahd appears momentarily surprised, but thanks them for their "magnanimity." "Sasha will show you the way," he adds, then turns to the other players. Sasha then bows to Strahd, takes the volunteer by the hand, and guides them toward <span class="citation">K21. South Tower Stair (p. 59)</span>. (As the player descends the stairs with Sasha, continue to [[#Sasha Alone]] below.)

As Sasha descends the stairs, Strahd asks the players about their trip to Ravenloft. “You found the journey comfortable, I hope?" he says. He is pleased if the players agree, noting that Castle Ravenloft “once entertained many guests," and it is a pleasure to host them once again.

While Sasha is gone, Strahd continues to engage the players in smalltalk, posing any or all of the following questions in no particular order:

* “You are newcomers to my land—without home or hall, I expect. I trust nonetheless that the hospitality of my people has been to your liking?" (If the players respond with a simple “yes" or “no," Strahd smiles and asks them to elaborate, noting, “It is good that the simple honor of hospitality is still remembered. Perhaps I may reward them for their kindness.")
* “I regret that the mists have concealed much of the valley’s once-radiant beauty. Still, I’m told you’re quite well-traveled across it. How have you found its inhabitants and vistas?"
* “The Old Svalich Road can be lonely when travelled alone. Have you found pleasant company amidst my domain?"

> [!abstract]+ **Strahd’s Opinions**
> If asked about the following residents or factions of Barovia, Strahd can share the following opinions:
>
> * ***Werewolf Pack.*** “A pack of feral animals, and twice as unruly. Still, with their excesses properly tamed, they have their uses."
>
> * ***Forest Folk.*** “They have none of their ancestors’ grace, and little of their wisdom. Their fanaticism, though flattering, occasionally leaves an unpleasant taste in one’s mouth. A lord who revels in worship is a fool, not a god."
>

> Cobwebs stretch between the columns that support the vaulted ceiling of a great, dusty hall dimly lit by sputtering torches in iron sconces. The torches cast odd shadows across the faces of eight stone gargoyles squatting motionlessly on the rim of the domed ceiling. Cracked and faded ceiling frescoes are covered by decay. Double doors of bronze stand closed to the east. To the north, a wide staircase climbs into darkness. A lit hallway to the south contains another set of bronze doors, through which you hear sad and majestic organ tones.
>

He fights only if attacked. Otherwise, he leads the characters to the dining hall ([area K10](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/cos/castle-ravenloft#K10DiningHall "area K10")), points them inside, pulls the doors shut behind them, and withdraws to [area K72](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/cos/castle-ravenloft#K72ChamberlainsOffice "area K72") by way of the South Tower Stair ([area K21](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/cos/castle-ravenloft#K21SouthTowerStair "area K21")).

The gargoyles also swoop down to fight if they are attacked. When the gargoyles attack, the turbulence in the air from their wings extinguishes the feeble torches in the sconces, plunging the hall into darkness unless the characters have light sources.

Next to the hallway, a suit of armor, oiled and glistening, stands at attention in a shallow alcove. To the west, large double doors hang slightly open, and a steady bright light escapes through the opening. Swells of organ music come from behind the doors, spilling their melody of power and defeat into the hall.

> Map: Elevator Trap [View Player Version](https://www.dndbeyond.com/attachments/2/769/cos401.jpg)
> 
> This hallway contains an elevator trap, triggered when at least 400 pounds of pressure is applied to the 10-foot-square section of floor in the center of the hall (marked T on the map), or when the lever in [area K31](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/cos/castle-ravenloft#K31Trapworks "area K31") is raised. A party of adventurers moving in close formation down the hall is certainly heavy enough to trigger the trap.
> 
> A character who searches for traps while crossing the hall and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check detects seams in the floor, walls, and ceiling that suggest that the middle section isn’t attached to the rest of the hall. A character who makes a successful DC 15 Intelligence ([Investigation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check discerns that the trap can’t be disarmed from this location.
> 
> The middle 10-foot section of the hall is a cleverly hidden elevator compartment, open to the north and south so that it appears to be part of the passageway. When the trap is sprung, two steel portcullises drop from the ceiling at lightning speed to seal off the compartment, trapping within those creatures that triggered the trap. An instant later, the closed-off elevator is propelled up the western half of a 20-foot-wide, 170-foot-tall shaft ([area K31a](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/cos/castle-ravenloft#K31aElevatorShaft "area K31a")) to the sounds of turning gears and rattling chains. Magic sleep gas fills the compartment as it rises, and a creature trapped inside must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or fall [unconscious](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnconsciousCondition) as though affected by a [sleep](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2254-sleep) spell.
> 
> At the same time the elevator rises, a 10-foot cube of granite suspended from heavy chains descends in the eastern half of the shaft, acting as a counterweight. The massive block lands gently at the bottom of the shaft, filling the previously open 10-foot-by-10-foot space adjacent to where the elevator stood. The block weighs thousands of tons and pulverizes anything in the space where it comes to rest.
> 
> Once the elevator starts rising, its portcullises are locked in place and can’t be lifted. The walls of the shaft are nearly flush with the elevator compartment; only a few inches of space exist between the portcullises and the shaft walls.
> 
> All creatures trapped inside the elevator (including [unconscious](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnconsciousCondition) ones) must roll initiative. The compartment takes 1 round to reach the top of the shaft, stopping just beneath [area K47](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/cos/castle-ravenloft#K47PortraitofStrahd "area K47"). Each creature inside has one turn to act before the compartment comes to a dead stop. Their initiative rolls determine the order in which the occupants act. Conscious party members can take whatever actions they like. They might search for a way out, wake sleeping party members, cast spells, or take other actions. [Unconscious](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnconsciousCondition) ones can do nothing.
> 
> A character who uses an action to search the ceiling of the elevator finds a secret trapdoor with a successful DC 10 Wisdom ([Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check. The trapdoor opens downward.
> 
> Any creature on top of the elevator when it reaches the top of the shaft must make a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw to avoid being crushed against the ceiling of the shaft. The character takes 44 (8d10) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. When the elevator comes to a stop, its portcullises retract.
> 
> The elevator remains at the top of the shaft until the lever in [area K31](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/cos/castle-ravenloft#K31Trapworks "area K31") is moved to the “down” position. When that happens, the trap resets in 1 round: the portcullises come down, and the elevator compartment descends to its place in the hallway at the bottom of the shaft as the stone block rises to the top of the shaft. When the elevator reaches the bottom, its portcullises rise again.
> 
> #### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/cos/castle-ravenloft#K61Development)Development
> 
> The sound of the elevator moving can be heard throughout the castle. Characters who are trapped or asleep in the elevator compartment are easy prey for Strahd, who can reach them by way of the trapdoor in [area K47](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/cos/castle-ravenloft#K47PortraitofStrahd "area K47").

>[!source]+ https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/cos/castle-ravenloft#K62ServantsHall
> 
> 
> This hall stands in deadly silence. Heavy beams support a sagging, ten-foot-high ceiling. Fog clings to the floor, obscuring everything that lies less than three feet above it. A giant shadow lurches across the ceiling as a dark figure shuffles purposefully down the corridor toward you.
> 
> The figure approaching is Cyrus Belview, a [mongrelfolk](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17367-mongrelfolk) (see [appendix D](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/cos/appendix-d-monsters-and-npcs#Mongrelfolk "appendix D")) and Strahd’s faithful servant. He stands 4 feet, 9 inches tall but appears shorter because of his hunched posture. He has the Keen Hearing and Smell feature. The left side his face is covered with lizard scales, and he has the ears of a panther. His left foot looks like a duck’s webbed foot, and his arms have patches of black dog fur.
> 
> The light in the hall comes from a lantern on the floor behind Cyrus. If the characters have their own light sources, Cyrus sees them, but he will not attack first. He wears a loop of twine around his neck, hanging from which is an iron key and a decorative wooden pendant fitted with a varnished human eyeball. The key unlocks the iron chest in [area K60](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/cos/castle-ravenloft#K60NorthTowerPeak "area K60"). The wooden pendant is a _hag eye_ given to Cyrus by the [night hag](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16965-night-hag) Morgantha (see [chapter 6](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/cos/old-bonegrinder "chapter 6")), so that she could spy on Strahd. Cyrus doesn’t know that the necklace is magical. See the “[Hag Covens](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm/monsters-h#HagCovens "Hag Covens")” sidebar in the hags entry in the [Monster Manual](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm "Monster Manual") for information about the _hag eye_.

> Cyrus Belview
> 
> Poor old Cyrus is obviously crazy. He has served the master for uncounted years and is devoted to him. Cyrus tries to get the characters to retire to their “room in the tower” ([area K49](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/cos/castle-ravenloft#K49Lounge "area K49")). If the characters aren’t sure what room he is talking about, he offers to lead them there.
> 
> If the characters follow Cyrus, he tells them to stay close to him as he leads them through the south door to [area K61](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/cos/castle-ravenloft#K61ElevatorTrap "area K61") and deliberately sets off the elevator trap there. Cyrus tries his best not to succumb to the sleeping gas as the elevator compartment climbs the shaft ([area K31](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/cos/castle-ravenloft#K31Trapworks "area K31")), and he has advantage on the saving throw. Assuming he’s still conscious when the elevator compartment reaches the top of the shaft, Cyrus opens the trapdoor to [area K47](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/cos/castle-ravenloft#K47PortraitofStrahd "area K47") and either leads the characters to [area K49](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/cos/castle-ravenloft#K49Lounge "area K49") or, if they’re [unconscious](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnconsciousCondition), drags them there. After assuring characters who are conscious that “the master will be along shortly,” Cyrus then makes his way back downstairs to the kitchen ([area K65](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/cos/castle-ravenloft#K65Kitchen "area K65")).
> 
> If the characters don’t go to their room, Cyrus shakes his head and returns to the work of preparing his dinner in [area K65](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/cos/castle-ravenloft#K65Kitchen "area K65"). If the characters take his key, he screams, “The master will not be pleased!” and begins to moan and slap his head, obviously upset. A successful DC 10 Charisma ([Intimidation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check is enough to make him divulge the key’s purpose, the location of the iron chest, and the chest’s contents.

(If the characters peer through the portcullis, read the boxed text for [area K63](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/cos/castle-ravenloft#K63WineCellar "area K63").) The portcullis bars are 1 inch thick and spaced 4 inches apart. The portcullis can be lifted with a successful DC 20 Strength check.

A character who inspects the cask closely and succeeds on a DC 13 Wisdom ([Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check sees yellow mold in the cracks between the planks of the cask. If this cask is smashed open, the yellow mold releases a cloud of spores.

If joined, Sasha remains silent as she descends the staircase, passes through <span class="citation">K61. Elevator Trap (p. 74)</span>, and enters <span class="citation">K62. Servants' Hall (p. 76)</span>. (The elevator trap is currently deactivated and doesn’t trigger when Sasha walks through it.) If any player attempts to speak to her, Sasha merely holds up a finger and shakes her head before glancing at the floor overhead, a grim frown upon her face.

The servants’ hall is largely as described in <span class="citation">K62. Servants’ Hall (p. 76)</span>. However, revise this area's description as follows: 

<div class="description">
<p>Heavy beams support the sagging, ten-foot-high ceiling of this long hall, its mortared walls illuminated by flickering torchlight. At the left end of the hall stands a pair of wooden doors, their heavy planks banded with steel. At the right end stands a raised metal portcullis, beyond which lies a dark wine cellar.</p>
<p>Three doors stand along the opposite wall beside a dark, ascending staircase. The middle door is open, warm light spilling forth onto the cold stone floor beside it. Two covered silver platters emanating delicious, mouthwatering scents drift from the door across the hall, as though held aloft by an invisible force.</p>
</div>

The open door leads to <span class="citation">K65. Kitchen (p. 78)</span>. The covered platters are carried by *unseen servants*, which are largely as described in <span class="citation">Unseen Servant (p. 51)</span>. 

The platters contain food intended for the dinner with Strahd. One platter contains a basket of fresh, hot rolls beside a tub of butter, while the second contains a bowl of sliced apples and pears spiced with cinnamon. If undisturbed, the platters approach the wooden doors to the left, which slowly creak open and permit the *unseen servants* to pass through before closing and locking, requiring a DC 20 Dexterity (Thieves’ Tools) check to open again. (The servants then pass through <span class="citation">K67. Hall of Bones (p. 78)</span> into <span class="citation">K68. Guards' Run (p. 79)</span>, ascend <span class="citation">K64. Guards' Stair (p. 78)</span> to the (cobweb-free) <span class="citation">K13. Turret Post Access Hall (p. 57)</span>, and pass through <span class="citation">K11. South Archers' Post (p. 57)</span> before exiting the (currently open) secret door in the archers’ post to deposit their goods in <span class="citation">K10. Dining Hall (p. 56)</span>.

> [!info]+ **Exploring the Larders**
> If a player moves to follow the *unseen servants*, Sasha first grabs their wrist, warning them in a harsh whisper that straying deeper into the castle risks their death—and worse, breaking guestright through trespassing. “If he learns that you have trespassed, you may wish you had died to another’s hand," she hisses. (It’s obvious that she is referring to Strahd.)
>
> Players who ignore Sasha and nonetheless attempt to slip after the *unseen servants* into <span class="citation">K67. Hall of Bones (p. 78)</span> must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw to block the doors from closing. If the players enter the Hall of Bones, the door to <span class="citation">K70. Kingsmen Hall (p. 79)</span> is locked with an _arcane lock_ spell, requiring a successful DC 30 Dexterity (Thieves’ Tools) check or DC 35 Strength check to open.

Sasha then enters the open door leading to the <span class="citation">K65. Kitchen (p. 78)</span>. If the player follows, read:

<div class="description">
<p>A thick cloud of smoke fills this steaming hot room, tinged with sweet and savory scents. A whole roast pig slowly turns over a blazing fire pit in the center of the room, its pink flesh browning and curling as its juices pop and hiss amongst the flames below.</p>
<p>The far wall is lined with pegs, hanging from which are numerous large cooking implements—some of which could easily double as implements of torture. A squat, bearded man busies himself about a pair of stoves not far away, one foot balanced precariously atop a grubby wooden stool as he leans forward to take a sip from a chipped wooden spoon.</p>
<p>Sasha clears her throat. “We require a pair of mops, Master Belview," she says politely. “There’s been a bit of a spill."</p>
</div>

The man is the **mongrelfolk** Cyrus Belview, and is largely as described in <span class="citation">K62. Servants’ Hall (p. 76)</span>. However, Cyrus has only served Strahd for a few months. He is irritated to have been interrupted, but absentmindedly tells Sasha that he "left the brooms in the wine cellar."

> [!profile]+ **Profile: Cyrus Belview**
> **Roleplaying Information**
> ***Resonance.*** Cyrus should inspire endearment for his sincere efforts to make himself useful despite his physical handicaps and poor memory, amusement for his grumpiness and bizarrely opinionated (and occasionally conspiratorial) rants, and discomfort with his inability to appreciate the boundaries of personal space.
>
> ***Emotions.*** Cyrus most often feels curious, intrigued, determined, agitated, impatient, or skeptical.
> 
> ***Motivations.*** Cyrus wants to help Strahd restore Castle Ravenloft, believing that Strahd will furnish him with the knowledge required to restore his family to their original forms.
> 
> ***Inspirations.*** When playing Cyrus, channel Ebenezar Scrooge (*A Christmas Carol*), Grandpa Simpson (*The Simpsons*), and Grand Maester Pycelle (*Game of Thrones*).
>
> **Character Information**
> ***Persona.*** To the world, Cyrus is a doddering old butler with an affinity for conspiratorial rants. To those he trusts—and in his moments of lucidity—Cyrus is a sad old man who has long since resigned himself to the belief that his family is forever damned for their ancestors’ sins.
>
> ***Morale.*** In a fight, Cyrus would cower in a corner, brandishing any nearby object as an impromptu weapon but immediately surrendering if actually wounded.
>
> ***Relationships.*** Cyrus is the former patriarch of the Belview family and the butler of Castle Ravenloft.

> [!abstract]+ **Talking to Cyrus**
> If the players ask Cyrus about his life at Castle Ravenloft or the Abbot’s “perfection" and mention Clovin, Otto, and Zygfrek Belview’s curiosity, Cyrus is initially reluctant to interrupt his cooking efforts to reply to them. If the players continue to press him for a response, however, and succeed on a DC 5 Charisma (Persuasion) check, Cyrus pauses, sighs, and shakes his head before replying, “They’re good kids. Tell them I’m well and thriving."
>
> If asked, Cyrus can share the following information:
>
> * More than a century ago, the Belview family came to the Abbey of Saint Markovia seeking transformation. The Abbot granted their wish, bestowing upon them the attributes of animals—a blessing which soon revealed itself to be a curse.
> * The Abbot, however, did not act alone. He gave the Belviews their bestial traits with the benefit of knowledge furnished by Strahd von Zarovich. While the Belviews have long sought the “perfection" of their forms, Cyrus believes that true salvation will only come once his family has returned to their true, human nature.
> * To this end, Cyrus agreed to work for Strahd as a butler at Castle Ravenloft at the Abbot’s recommendation. Strahd has promised him that, should Cyrus restore the castle to its former glory and maintain that restoration for a period of ten years, he will furnish Cyrus with the knowledge necessary to restore his family to their original forms—curing them of their infirmities and madness forever.

If the player follows Sasha to the wine cellar, this area is largely as described in <span class="citation">K63. Wine Cellar (p. 77)</span>, but the right-side southern cask is full of Purple Grapemash No. 3, rather than being rotted and empty. In addition, add the following text to the end of this area’s description:

<div class="description">
<p>A dead woman is strung up from a rope tied around her heels, her face frozen in a ghoulish, terrified expression. Her throat has been slit, and drops of blood slowly drain from her slashed neck into a ceramic basin below.</p>
<p>Sasha gives you a quiet, sideways glance as she moves to retrieve a pair of mops leaning against the wall nearby. “You did not forget that you were dining with monsters, did you?" she asks humorlessly, her mouth twisted in distaste.</p>
</div>

Sasha then asks suspiciously why the player chose to follow her into the larders. “If you have some deeper motive, then speak it," she growls.

If confronted regarding her lack of loyalty to Strahd, Sasha stiffens, glances fearfully down the hall, and insists woodenly that she is wholly faithful to him. A player can convince her to speak freely by succeeding on a DC 10 Charisma (Persuasion) check, succeeding automatically if they mention their victories over Strahd’s other brides or otherwise provide comfort and reassurance. 

If convinced to speak freely, Sasha closes her eyes, takes a deep breath, and leans toward the player’s ear before whispering: “After dinner, find an excuse to linger in the dining hall. Once you are alone, press the sixth pedal from the left on the organ. I shall meet you in the chamber beyond. Do not allow *him* to know what you are doing."

Sasha won’t elaborate further. Instead, once her message has been received, she immediately moves to return upstairs.
# O5. Dinner is Served
As smalltalk concludes in the <span class="citation">K8. Great Entry (p. 55)</span>, Rahadin approaches the group, bows, and announces that dinner is served. Strahd thanks him, turns to the players, and asks, “Shall we?" If the players concur, Rahadin then leads them into <span class="citation">K10. Dining Hall (p. 56)</span>. 

The brides and Escher then turn to depart via <span class="citation">K21. South Tower Stair (p. 59)</span>.

In the center of the room, a long, heavy table is covered with a fine white satin cloth. The table is laden with many delectable foods: roasted beast basted in a savory sauce, roots and herbs of every taste, and sweet fruits and vegetables. Places are set for each of you with fine, delicate china and silver. At each place is a crystal goblet filled with an amber liquid with a delicate, tantalizing fragrance.
> 
> At the center of the far west wall, between floor-to-ceiling mirrors, stands a massive organ. Its pipes blare out a thunderous melody that speaks in its tone of greatness and despair. Seated at the organ, facing away from you, a single caped figure pounds the keys in raptured ecstasy. The figure suddenly stops, and as a deep silence falls over the dining hall, it slowly turns toward you.
> 
> The figure is an illusion of Strahd. It welcomes the characters and invites them to dine. The illusion acts like Strahd and plays the part of the gracious host, speaking kindly and telling the characters that they’re free to explore the castle. “Strahd” might talk about his family or shed light on the castle’s history, but the illusion provides no useful information about the castle’s inhabitants, treasures, or dangers other than to say that the castle doesn’t receive many guests. The illusory vampire converses with the characters for no more than 3 rounds, never moving from the organ bench. When the time is up, or if the illusion is attacked, it simply disappears with a mocking laugh.
> 
> The moment the figure disappears, a fierce, bone-chilling wind rises up and roars through the hall, putting out all open flames. The characters hear the screech of ancient hinges and the solid thud of many heavy doors slamming shut, one after another, into the distance. They also hear the portcullis clang shut and the tired groan of the aged drawbridge pulling up. Finally, unless the doors to this room are being held open, they slam shut (but do not lock). If the characters open the doors, they see that all the torches in areas K7, K8, and K9 have gone out.
> 
> The organ appears locked in place and immovable, but a character who makes a successful DC 20 Wisdom ([Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check notices scratch marks on the floor that suggest that the organ can be slid outward. A character who tries pushing various keys and pedals discovers that one of the pedals, when depressed, causes the organ to slide outward about 2 feet, allowing access to a secret door in the back wall that swings open into area K11. Because this secret door is hidden behind the organ, it can’t be found and opened until the organ is moved out of the way.
> 
> The food on the table is tasty, the wine delicious.

The dining hall is largely as described in <span class="citation">K10. Dining Hall (p. 56)</span>. However, remove the last three sentences of this area’s description referring to the figure seated at the organ. In addition, move the first sentence of the second paragraph, referring to the floor-to-ceiling mirrors and the organ, immediately after the first sentence of the first paragraph.

As the players enter, Strahd takes his place at the head of the table by the organ then invites them to be seated.

> [!info]+ **Strahd’s Dinner**
> During the meal, Strahd takes a glass of blood-red wine alongside a plate of roast pig and root vegetables. However, a player with a passive Wisdom (Insight) of 13 or more notices that Strahd never touches his food, appearing content to sip the liquid from his glass. 
>
> If asked whether the liquid in his glass is blood, Strahd merely smiles faintly, as if laughing at some private joke, and asks the player what *they* believe his drink to be. (He does not, however, deny that it is blood.)
>
> If Strahd is confronted regarding the dead Barovian in the wine cellar, or if the players otherwise confront him regarding his predatory nature, he retorts calmly, “All men must act according to their natures—it is the nature of the strong to bend the world to their will, just as it is the nature of the wise to accept the world as it is. There are tyrants in this world who place children’s heads upon pikes for the sins of their fathers; emperors who starve their subjects of bread and gold alike." He then takes a long draught from his glass before meeting his confronter’s gaze directly and adding, “I do not deny that I take what I require. But all lords demand their due—and I take no more than necessary."
## O5b. Making Conversation
Throughout the course of the meal, Strahd continues the conversation that began in the foyer, inviting the players to share:

* Their lands of origin,
* Their experiences with magic and/or faith,
* The histories of their families and people, and
* The origins and extent of their expertise.

Strahd enjoys theological debates with clerics, paladins and druids; appreciates learning of the martial training and strategy of barbarians, fighters, rangers, rogues, and monks; and is intrigued by the craft and research of artificers, wizards, bards, sorcerers, and warlocks.

Strahd is also willing to share the following information about himself, though he prefers listening to speaking, and will always turn an anecdote about himself into a question regarding a player’s interests or history:

* His father was King Barov von Zarovich II, a great king and general. It was at his side that Strahd learned the arts of war and conquest, bringing order to a land wrought with chaos and confusion.
* In the wake of his father’s death, Strahd took command of his father’s armies, leading them into battle to reclaim his family’s ancestral lands. “Old Zarovia, it was called then," he shares. “A whisper of a memory that our enemies had taken from us long ago."
* Barovia, he notes, was the final, small piece of the empire his father sought to claim: a valley guarding the mountain pass at the nation’s eastern edge. “When I first looked upon its snow-capped peaks and beheld its beauty, I knew I had come home—to the rightful seat of my family’s legacy," he says, sounding nearly wistful.
## O5c. Strahd’s Questions
As the conversation winds to a close, Strahd advises the players that he seeks to “explore their wit and cunning," and invites them to participate in a game of three questions. “As lord of this land, he says, “it intrigues me to learn how others might evaluate the dilemmas that power so often presents." He assures them that there are no incorrect answers; instead, a player’s answer to a question merely reveals a part of themself to the others at the table.

If the players accept, Strahd then poses the following three hypothetical questions to the players, proceeding to the next question only once all players have had a chance to answer and (if necessary) debate and discuss the hypothetical:

* “Imagine that you are the liege and master of a vassal lord. When you descend to collect this year’s taxes from your vassal’s village, your accountant reports that the year’s taxes are woefully short. When asked to explain, the lord explains that the harvests have been lean and sickness has plagued the village. You notice, however, that the lord wears a fine gold chain around his neck and a new wool cloak with buttons crafted of pure silver. What do you do?"
* “Imagine that you are the monarch of a realm. One day, a fearsome archmage raises an army of the undead in rebellion against you. As he approaches your keep, you have an opportunity to parlay with him upon the drawbridge of your castle. What do you do?"
* “Imagine again that you are the monarch of a realm. As you sleep in your bed, an assassin slips into your chambers, but is frightened away by your guards’ timely arrival before your throat can be slit. What do you do?

When the players answer his final question, Strahd notes that he has survived the daggers of many assassins throughout his life—as a soldier, as a king, and even “since his rebirth into undeath." 

He then sighs, looks briefly thoughtful, and adds, “Although I am loath to sully a night of fellowship and merriment with matters of business, I must confess I have suffered the attentions of one such assassin quite recently—a viper by the name of Rudolph van Richten." Strahd carefully surveys the players’ expressions, one eyebrow lifting as he asks, “To my regret, however, my servants were unable to apprehend him. I believe him to still be at large. Have you heard any whispering of his presence in your travels through my domain?"

A player with knowledge of Van Richten’s whereabouts must succeed on a DC 19 Charisma (Deception) check to successfully deceive Strahd when replying to him. However, Strahd treats all responses as though they are truthful, though a player who fails the check notices a knowing glint in Strahd’s eye as he replies to their answer.
# O6. Touring the Castle
As dinner concludes, Strahd thanks the players for dining with him and offers them a brief tour of the castle. “I fear it has fallen from its former glory since I first began my slumber," he notes somberly, “but I hope that those with vision can see it for the marvel it once was." If the players accept his offer, Strahd leads them from the dining hall. 

> [!abstract]+ **Meeting Sasha**
> If any player asks to remain behind in the dining hall (i.e., with the intent of meeting up with Sasha in secret) and offers a reasonable excuse (such as to admire the organ or digest the rich meal), Strahd briefly offers them an inquisitive look, then gladly grants their request.
> 
> He dryly warns them, however, "not to stray from the hall." "Many things lurk in the dark corners of this keep," he notes. "It would be a shame if we were to lose your company so soon. I shall send Escher to collect you when our tour has concluded." (See [[#O6e. Sasha’s Rendezvous]] for more information on this player's conversation with Sasha.)

After exiting the dining hall, Strahd leads the party on the following route:

Before departing the Great Entry, Strahd encourages one or more of the players to take a torch from a sconce in the Guests’ Hall to light their way. “My eyes are well-adjusted to the shadows that lurk in these halls," he says wryly, “but a mobile source of light might be kinder to your own senses."

> 


This area is as described in <span class="citation">K14. Hall of Faith (p. 57)</span>.

As he guides the players through this area, Strahd shares that the castle was built over four centuries prior upon the ruins of a much older fortress, which lay atop the Pillarstone of Ravenloft. “I put out the call for mages, architects, and engineers from every corner of my conquests," he says fondly, “and from every corner, they came."

> Dim, colored light filters through tall, broken, and boarded-up windows of stained glass, illuminating the ancient chapel of Ravenloft. A few bats flutter about near the top of the ninety-foot-high domed ceiling. A balcony runs the length of the west wall, fifty feet above the floor. In the center of the balcony, two dark shapes are slumped in tall chairs.
> 
> Benches coated with centuries of dust lie about the floor in jumbled disarray. Beyond this debris, lit by a piercing shaft of light, an altar stands upon a stone platform. The sides of the altar are carved with bas-reliefs of angelic figures entwined with grape vines. The light from above falls directly on a silver statuette. A cloaked figure is draped over the altar, and a black mace lies on the floor near its feet.
> 
> The figure slumped on the altar is all that remains of Gustav Herrenghast, a lawful evil human cleric who tried to obtain the [Icon of Ravenloft](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/5530-icon-of-ravenloft) and did not survive the attempt.

A character who inspects the wall closely can spot the chink with a successful DC 10 Wisdom ([Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check. The wall is too sturdy for characters to knock down, but they can create a hole wide enough to crawl through in 1 hour, or reduce the entire wall to a pile of masonry bricks and rubble in 2 hours.
> 
> Thirty feet below the masonry wall and 50 feet above the foot of the steps, a small crack has formed in the outer wall of the stairwell.

Between the staircases are twin alcoves, each one containing a standing suit of armor covered with dark stains. Each suit of armor clutches a mace, the “business end” of which is shaped like a dragon’s head. Words engraved on the arches above the suits of armor have been scratched out.

Anyone who crosses in front of the alcoves along the south wall activates the suits of armor.

> Both suits of armor are mechanical traps, each one activated by a pressure plate hidden in the floor in front of its alcove. A character who searches for traps in one of these locations notices both pressure plates with a successful DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check.
> 
> When 40 or more pounds of weight are placed on a pressure plate, the suit of armor nearest to that plate springs forward, flailing its arms and wielding its mace. Any creature standing on a pressure plate when its trap triggers must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage from the flailing armor. After leaping out and attacking, the armor retracts. The pressure plate resets after 1 minute, after which its armor trap can be triggered again.

However, remove the remains of Gustav Herrenghast and the *Icon of Ravenloft* (renamed in this guide as the *Icon of Dawn's Grace*) from the Chapel. In addition, remove any reference to these remains, the *Icon of Ravenloft*, and the “piercing shaft of light" from this area’s description. In addition, remove the two **Strahd zombies** from the King’s Balcony.

Upon entering the chapel, Strahd reminisces aloud: “I recall the day Prefect Ciril Romulich first dedicated this sacred hall to the glory of the Morninglord. Each man and woman had such faith in the power of his consecration—yet behold what it has become." He shakes his head, then asks the players, curiously: “What is it that you have faith in?"

Strahd is clearly amused by any players who declare faith in a deity or religion. When all players have shared the source of their faith, if any, he turns to regard the great stained-glass sun in the highest chapel window and says, “I have never found much use for faith in other things or creatures. Far better, it seems, to place one’s faith entirely in one’s self, and to master one’s fate without reliance upon others. Do you disagree?"

This area is largely as described in <span class="citation">K27. King’s Hall (p. 61)</span>. However, this room now contains the tapestry described in <span class="citation">K83a. Spiral Stair Landing (p. 85)</span>, which is located midway along the corridor's south wall, covering the secret door that leads to <span class="citation">K31. Trapworks (p. 63)</span>. Add the description of that tapestry to the end of this area’s description.

In addition, the mannequin trap is currently disarmed and doesn’t activate as the characters walk through the corridor.

As the players approach the tapestry, Strahd pauses beside it. “Do you know who this tapestry depicts?" he asks.

Strahd can share that the tapestry depicts his father, King Barov, leading his fearsome knights into glorious battle. If the players ask about the sword King Barov is wielding, Strahd shares that it was the *Brightblade*—a sword fashioned from the hilt of an elven *Moonblade* and a crystal blade imbued with the radiance of the Morninglord. “It was broken long ago, however," he adds quietly, his voice oddly hollow.

This area is largely as described in <span class="citation">K25. Audience Hall (p. 61)</span>. However, revise the first sentence of this area’s description as follows:

<div class="description">
<p>Dim light from the courtyard falls into this great hall through the broken glass and iron latticework of a large window in the west wall. A cold wind shrieks through the broken window as arcs of lightning lance from the weeping skies beyond, each bolt followed by the crack of nearby thunder.</p>
</div>

> [!abstract]+ **Calling Escher**
> If one of the players remained behind in the dining hall to rendezvous with Sasha, Strahd clicks his tongue, summoning a lone **bat** hanging from the ceiling by the window. "Ask Escher to collect our guest in the dining hall," he commands. The bat chirps a single time, then flutters out through the window into the rain.

If any player asks why the throne is turned away from the rest of the room, Strahd lauds them for their perceptiveness. He then shares the following information:

* When Strahd was a child, Saint Andral anointed his father, King Barov, as the rightful heir to the crown of old Zarovia. When King Barov died, Strahd inherited his crown, and with it the title of King.
* However, when the Mists descended upon Barovia, the lands Strahd had conquered were consigned to history, his family’s ancestral legacy forsaken and lost. “It would be an arrogance beyond folly to name myself ‘king’ without a kingdom to rule," Strahd says, “and so I keep the King’s seat turned from my reach as a memento of the lands that I lost." He then adds softly: “And yet—few things are lost forever." (If asked to elaborate, Strahd declines and simply smiles wryly.)
## O6e. Sasha’s Rendezvous

This area is as described in <span class="citation">K11. South Archers' Post (p. 57)</span>. If Sasha instructed a player to meet her here, she begins clinging to the ceiling immediately above the entryway. As the player enters, she descends from the shadows behind them and whispers fiercely, “Were you followed?", revealing herself only if provided sufficient assurances.

Sasha warns the player that she has little time, and that their absences will surely be noted if they tarry here. She then demands to know why they approached and confronted her. “It seems you do not intend to have me killed," she observes dryly. “But it also seems you’ve given me little choice but to comply with your demands."

Sasha can share any or all of the following information about herself if asked:

* She is Sasha Ivliskova, Strahd’s first and eldest bride. He wed her nearly four centuries ago, in the wake of the loss of his first love, Tatyana Federovna. He grew tired of her, however, and when she dared challenge him, he locked her away in a crypt for four hundred years, freeing her for unknown purposes shortly after his recent awakening. (If asked what the experience was like, Sasha says dully, “it was maddening—and a time that I wish to forget forever.")
* She despises Strahd with every fiber of her being. “I am old, and I am tired," she hisses. “There are two things I wish to see before I die: the light of the rising sun, and the death of the monster Strahd von Zarovich."

If the player doesn’t reveal their interest in infiltrating Castle Ravenloft, Sasha asks them outright if they approached her because they wish to steal from the castle. In either case, she is willing to share information about the castle’s contents, layout, and inhabitants—as well as a time when Strahd will be away from the keep—if the players agree to take a certain prisoner with them when they do. “Her name is Gertruda," Sasha says, her brows furrowed in worry. “She is a villager from Barovia, spirited away as she trod the road toward Vallaki. She is alive, for now, but I fear for her life should she linger any longer in the keep. She's asked me to help free her, if I can—a request that, until now, I had no hope of fulfilling."

> [!lore]+ **Strahd's Scheme**
> Unbeknownst to Sasha, Gertruda has been charmed by Strahd since the day she first arrived in the castle. Although Gertruda's friendship with Sasha is real, it was Strahd who told Gertruda to seek Sasha's aid in escaping.
> 
> Strahd hopes to use Gertruda as bait to lure the players to the castle while he's away, seeking to test their skills against his brides. Although he has no knowledge of the players' other objectives at the castle—such as obtaining Argynvost's skull or freeing the **werewolf** Emil Toranescu—he has been disappointed with his brides' performance against the players, and hopes to orchestrate an opportunity to separate the wheat from the chaff. Should the players succeed, Strahd believes, they will have proven themselves worthy of becoming his vampiric generals in the wars to come.

If the players agree to rescue Gertruda, Sasha can share the following information about Castle Ravenloft:

* Ever since his awakening, Strahd has departed the castle once each fortnight atop his **nightmare** steed Beucephalus on the night of the new moon. Sasha doesn’t know where he goes, or what he does, but she knows that he doesn’t return until the morning’s first light. Sasha can further share that the next new moon is tomorrow night—and that she has no reason to believe that Strahd won’t repeat the pattern again.
* Gertruda is a prisoner on the third floor of the castle, in the king’s suites. The players can access the suites via the staircase in the foyer (<span class="citation">K21. South Tower Stair, p. 59</span>).
* Sasha doesn’t know any of the traps that Strahd or his servants might have set in the castle. She does know, however, that the inside of the keep is often patrolled by undead **wights**—the animated remains of those that once guarded the castle.
* Strahd keeps prisoners in the dungeons, on the floor beneath the castle larders. The players can access the dungeons via the staircase in the foyer (<span class="citation">K21. South Tower Stair, p. 59</span>).
* Sasha has seen a dragon’s skull once—in a basement chamber that Volenta has more recently transformed into an ossuary. The chamber (<span class="citation">K67. Hall of Bones (p. 78)</span>) is behind the closed wooden doors to the west of <span class="citation">K65. Kitchen (p. 78)</span>.
* Although she hasn’t descended there since Strahd freed her from her crypt, the castle catacombs are accessible via <span class="citation">K18. High Tower Staircase (p. 58)</span>.
* Strahd has commanded his spawn to report the presence of any intruders into the castle, and Sasha therefore can’t help the players enter the keep herself. However, she can share the existence of a second, rear servants’ entrance (<span class="citation">K23. Servants’ Entrance (p. 59))</span> into the castle via <span class="citation">K3. Servants’ Courtyard (p. 54)</span>, which allows access to the servants’ quarters and kitchens.
* Should the players require it while navigating the castle, Sasha recalls that Strahd's oldest password is "I come in Dostron's memory." She isn't sure who Dostron is, or whether Strahd still uses it as a password, but believes him arrogant enough to believe that none in the castle—other than Rahadin—is old enough to remember it. (Sasha doesn't know it, but the players can use this password to open both the *Tome of Strahd*, as described in [[Arc H - The Lost Soul]], and the *Daern's Instant Fortress* located in <span class="citation">K41. Treasury (p. 67)</span>).

Sasha warns the players that they likely won't be able to depart the castle without facing Rahadin, the castle chamberlain. "The master of the castle may be gone," she tells them, "but his right hand stalks the shadows of any who enter."

Sasha’s memory and knowledge of the castle is limited beyond this information, and she apologizes for any inability to answer the players’ additional questions. 

When the player has exhausted her knowledge, Sasha informs them curtly that they both must return to the castle’s halls before they are missed, and bids them luck as they depart. Before she leaves, the player notices her cast a final, mournful glance at the mirrors on the floor—none of which bear her reflection—then sigh and step away into <span class="citation">K12. Turret Post (p. 57)</span>.

Shortly after the player returns to the dining hall and closes the secret door, Escher enters the chamber to collect them and escort them upstairs through <span class="citation">K8. Great Entry (p. 55)</span>, up the stairs of <span class="citation">K19. Grand Landing (p. 58)</span>, and into <span class="citation">K25. Audience Hall (p. 61)</span> to meet the other players.
## O6f. The Prisoner
Shortly after all of the players have reunited in the Audience Hall, Rahadin ascends <span class="citation">K19. Grand Landing (p. 58)</span> and enters the room accompanied by another figure. Read:

<div class="description">
<p>Rahadin holds a chain in his right hand, its links connected to a steel collar clamped tightly around the neck of the stumbling figure he drags forward behind him. The figure’s features are obscured by the sack they wear over their head, their clothes torn away and replaced by a threadbare, shapeless robe.</p>
</div>

Strahd greets Rahadin warmly. “Punctual as always, I see," he says.

Upon approaching Strahd and the players, Rahadin halts, then yanks the chain harshly forward, forcing the prisoner to kneel. “The prisoner awaits your judgment, my lord," he says coldly.

At Strahd’s nod, Rahadin rips away the sack covering the figure’s head, revealing its features. Read:

<div class="description">
<p>The figure is a man, his eyes wide and terrified. His body, however, has been warped beyond recognition—his muscles grotesquely swollen, his skin cracked and fissured like parched earth. Most unsettling of all are the four lumps that adorn his shoulders, each resembling a tiny, misshapen head with its eyes squeezed shut.</p>
</div>

Strahd then turns toward the players expectantly and shares the following information:

* The man is a convicted murderer. He was a Vallakian who murdered his neighbor after he caught his wife and the neighbor having an affair. (“I’m told he tore a wooden beam from the victim’s own home and used it to crush him to death," Strahd says gravely, shaking his head. “A savage brute.") For his crimes, he was sentenced to death.
* Strahd has been impressed with the players’ martial prowess—but seeks to see what they will do when faced with an enemy that bears no sword. “A lord’s justice is unlike the justice of the battlefield," he says, “and it has come time to decide how this creature will pass from this world." He regards them inquisitively. “How should it be done?"

> [!lore]+ **The Convict**
> The man is Alek Tyminski, a butcher from Vallaki. Upon purchasing a catch of fresh fish from the fisherman Bluto Krogarov, Alek found an *amber shard* buried in the stomach of one of the fish. The shard, which bore a connection to the vestige Great Taar Haak, the Five-Headed Destroyer, promised Alek the power to inflict his will upon the world. 
>
> When Alek later caught his wife, Korina, in bed with his neighbor Korga, Alek accepted Taar Haak’s boon and gained great strength—at the expense of his physical appearance. Alek then tore a wooden beam from the wall of Korga’s home, which he then used to crush Korga to death. Lady Wachter’s guards, aided by her **cult fanatics**, managed to capture him shortly thereafter.

If the players ask Strahd why the man’s body is disfigured, he notes gravely that “there are some in Barovia who attempt to deal with powers far darker than I." He regards the man with obvious distaste, adding solemnly, “One way or another, they all receive their reward in the end."

Strahd defers to the players to decide how the man should be executed. If the players are able to settle on a decision, Strahd then invites them to carry out the sentence themselves—"if they have the stomach for it."

If the players fail to decide upon a sentence, or if they fail to carry it out themselves, Strahd shakes his head in disappointment and gestures for Rahadin to replace the sack over the man’s head. “A pity," he mourns. “I’d hoped for a better showing from you. Ludmilla shall have him instead, then. I expect she’ll enjoy inspecting his numerous deformities."

If the players move to kill him, the man begins to laugh as he dies. “I smell amber," he wheezes, his voice gravelly. “You think yourselves above me, but you carry its stink as well." He gasps for breath, then rasps, “Does it whisper to you as well, I wonder?" before dying.

If the players carry out the sentence, Strahd congratulates them on their strength of will. “Not all would have the constitution to mete out justice as you have," he says approvingly. If the players ask about the “stink of amber" the man mentioned, Strahd raises an eyebrow and says, “There are many accursed things long-since lost in this land. It is best not to dwell on them overmuch as this poor soul did."
## O6g. The Broken Drawbridge
Following the events of [[#O6f. The Prisoner]], Strahd thanks the players for an enjoyable evening and the pleasure of their company, and suggests that the night is sadly drawing to a close. As he does, a bolt of lightning strikes one of the drawbridge towers. Read:

<div class="description">
<p>A flash of blinding white fills the air above the courtyard, and an explosion of sound rattles the broken glass and iron latticework of the chamber’s large window. As the acrid scent of ozone fills the room, you see a cloud of thick, black smoke rising from one of the towers beside the raised drawbridge.</p>
</div>

If necessary, Strahd reassures the players that they are in no danger, and that it simply appears that a stray bolt of lightning has struck a part of the keep.

Shortly after the lightning strike, Ludmilla enters the chamber from <span class="citation">K19. Grand Landing (p. 58)</span>, her expression stony. She bows deeply before Strahd, then informs him that it appears a bolt of lightning has struck the south gate tower. She shares that she has dispatched Diavola, one of her apprentices, to inspect the tower mechanism and determine whether any repairs are required.

Strahd then invites the players to join him in the <span class="citation">K8. Great Entry (p. 55)</span> for refreshments as they wait for Diavola’s report. If Escher is present (i.e., because one of the players met with Sasha in [[#O6e. Sasha’s Rendezvous]]), Strahd directs him to send for wine and tea from the kitchens. Otherwise, Strahd clicks his tongue, summoning a lone **bat** hanging from the ceiling, and directs it to do the same. The bat chirps a single time, then flutters down through <span class="citation">K19. Grand Landing (p. 58)</span>.

Shortly after the players descend to the Great Entry, if Strahd sent Escher to the kitchens, he ascends <span class="citation">K21. South Tower Stair (p. 59)</span> bearing a tray containing mugs of spiced wine and herbal tea. (If Strahd sent the bat, Sasha delivers the drinks instead.) As they enjoy their refreshments, Strahd apologizes to the players for the delay and inconvenience, but notes, “I have full faith in Ludmilla and her associates to remedy any problem."

After a few minutes have passed, the great doors leading from <span class="citation">K7. Entry (p. 54)</span> open to reveal Diavola, an unhappy and soaking-wet **Barovian witch**.

The conversation then unfolds as follows unless the players intervene:

* Ludmilla turns to Diavola and instructs her to “deliver her report to the Master."
* Diavola casts her eyes toward the ground as she bows hurriedly toward Strahd, stammering: “Forgive me, Great One. The lightning has scorched the runes inscribed into the upper tower. The bridge—it will not work until the runes are freshly cast."
* Strahd asks Diavola coldly if she can re-cast the tower runes. She nods, wringing her hands and licking her lips, and adds, “Yes—but I would require the aid of the full coven. And even then, it could take us until morning."
* “Then see that it is done by then," Strahd replies sternly. “You are dismissed." Diavola bows deeply, then flees up <span class="citation">K21. South Tower Stair (p. 59)</span> until she reaches <span class="citation">K54. Familiar Room (p. 71)</span>, where she rejoins the other **Barovian witches**.

Strahd then turns to the players and apologizes again for the inconvenience, noting that it appears unlikely that he will be able to send them home via the carriage that evening. “Should you wish it, I would be more than glad to have rooms prepared for the night," he promises. “Our guest quarters are warm and comfortable, and in far better condition than many other chambers of the castle." 

If any players appear uncomfortable with accepting Strahd’s hospitality, he assures them that “no servant of mine will lay a hand on you for as long as you remain within your rooms—and you will, of course, be free to go in the morning, once the storm subsides and the bridge is repaired." 

If the players refuse Strahd’s hospitality outright, he shakes his head and notes that, to his regret, he cannot allow them to simply sleep elsewhere in the castle. “You are welcome, of course, to pitch your tents in the front courtyard—but I cannot guarantee your safety from any creatures that may lurk amidst the castle grounds."

If any player suggests using flight to cross the chasm, Strahd warns them that “the storm may be far less kind than you expect—and you would not be the first individual to lose their lives in a flight of folly from the castle walls." (If asked, Strahd briefly shares the tragedy of Prince Ariel du Plumette, whose tale is as described in <span class="citation">Crypt 4 (p. 86)</span>.)

> [!info]+ **No Escape**
> During the storm, the skies around Castle Ravenloft are filled with **heavy precipitation** and a **strong wind** (<span class="citation">Dungeon Master’s Guide, p. 110</span>), rendering the fifty-foot chasm near-impassable by any flying creature. (Remember that a flying creature carrying another creature of similar size moves at half speed, and that a flying creature in a strong wind must land at the end of its turn or fall.) In addition, the direction of the wind faces toward the castle, making the air difficult terrain for any creature attempting to fly away from the keep.
>
> For example, a rogue enchanted with the *fly* spell has a fly speed of 60 feet, reduced to 30 feet while flying through difficult terrain. If the rogue is carrying another player, the rogue’s speed is further reduced to 15 feet from the encumbrance. Even if the rogue dashes twice, the rogue can’t move more than 45 feet before being forced to land or fall—sending the rogue and their cargo plummeting into the chasm unless they choose to turn back before reaching the midpoint.

Should the players accept Strahd’s offer of hospitality, he claps his hands together and calls for Escher or Sasha—depending on which one is present—to "show our guests to their rooms, please."

Strahd then bids the players goodnight, remaining within the Great Entry to speak with Ludmilla as Escher (or Sasha) instructs the players to follow him (or her) to their rooms. “Do not stray from my path," Escher or Sasha warns, taking a torch from the wall of <span class="citation">K9. Guests’ Hall (p. 56)</span>, “unless you wish to die a most painful death."

Escher or Sasha then leads the players up <span class="citation">K21. South Tower Stair (p. 59)</span>, past the second-floor landing leading to <span class="citation">K30. King’s Accountant (p. 62)</span>, past the third-floor landing leading to <span class="citation">K35. Guardian Vermin (p. 64)</span>, and onto the fourth-floor landing comprising <span class="citation">K47. Portrait of Strahd (p. 68)</span>. 

If Escher is the players' guide, he is curt and visibly slouching as he shows the players upstairs. (Escher, who enjoys using the Lounge as a comfortable place to relax or sulk, is sour and jealous that the players have temporarily stolen his favorite haunt in the castle. A player can identify his bitterness with a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Insight) check.)

> You come to a dark landing ten feet wide and twenty feet long. A cold draft of wind rushes down the spiral staircase at the north end of the east wall and whistles mournfully through the room before streaming down the stairs to the south.
> 
> An ornate, square rug covers the floor to the south. Set into the west wall is an ironbound wooden door with a wooden trapdoor set into the floor in front of it. Hanging on the north wall above the trapdoor is a framed portrait of a handsome, well-dressed man with a serene yet penetrating gaze.

> 
> The wooden, square trapdoor is 4 feet on a side and as thick as the floor, with recessed iron hinges and an iron ring built into the side opposite the hinges. Pulling up on the ring opens the door. Below the trapdoor, characters see one of two things: either a 170-foot-deep shaft ([area K31a](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/cos/castle-ravenloft#K31aElevatorShaft "area K31a")) or, if the elevator trap has been activated (see [area K61](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/cos/castle-ravenloft#K61ElevatorTrap "area K61")), a stone elevator compartment with a secret hatch in its top.

The landing at the top of <span class="citation">K21. South Tower Stair (p. 59)</span> is largely as described in <span class="citation">K47. Portrait of Strahd (p. 68)</span>. However, neither the **rug of smothering** nor **guardian portrait** attacks the players for the duration of their stay at Ravenloft.
### Escher's Jealousy
If Escher escorted the players to their rooms, he steps into <span class="citation">K49. Lounge (p. 70)</span> and sweeps his arm dramatically across the room. "I hope everything is to your liking," he says icily, his eyes narrowing. "Is there anything else of mine you'd like to take?"

Escher, who is jealous of the players, anxious about losing Strahd's favor, and desperate to justify his betrayal of Doru's rebellion, is hungry for a confrontation with Strahd's new "playthings." Unless forced to depart, he attempts to needle the players, insulting their appearances, lack of culture, or "disappointing intelligence." "I can't imagine why he's kept you around this long," Escher hisses. "Perhaps he just thinks you'll squeal particularly loudly when he inevitably tires of you."

If challenged regarding his position in Strahd's court, Escher angrily insists that he "*earned* his place at Lord Strahd's right hand," and vows that the players are "incapable of imagining the loyalty Lord Strahd has toward him." 

If confronted regarding his betrayal of Doru's rebellion, Escher is taken aback, then angrily denies playing any role in Doru's downfall. "His end was inevitable," he insists. "Such is the fate of any who defies Lord Strahd's will." (A player who succeeds on a DC 13 Wisdom (Insight) check learns that Escher appears to be attempting to convince himself as much as the players.)

As Escher's confrontation with the players comes to a close, Rahadin appears silently at the door and clears his throat, startling Escher. Rahadin warns the players that they are not to leave their chambers until morning, noting with a stern glower that “dark things” roam the castle at night—and that undue curiosity, in the home of his master, can be a fatal flaw. “To ensure your safety, Escher shall stand guard at your door through the night,” he adds, much to Escher’s obvious surprise and resentment.

Before departing, Rahadin also produces a key from his pocket, which he uses to lock the players in the guest suite—again, “for their safety.” He will return to unlock the door, he promises, at the first light of morning.
### Sasha's Insight
If Sasha escorted the players to their rooms, she hesitates before departing. If confronted regarding her lack of loyalty to Strahd she stiffens, glances fearfully about her, and insists woodenly that she is wholly faithful to him. A player can convince her to speak freely by succeeding on a DC 10 Charisma (Persuasion) check, succeeding automatically if they mention their victories over Strahd’s other brides or otherwise provide comfort and reassurance. 

If convinced to speak freely, Sasha closes her eyes, takes a deep breath, and asks if she can step into <span class="citation">K49. Lounge (p. 70)</span> to speak with the players in private. If the players agree, she closes the door behind her and continues speaking in hushed tones.

Once inside the lounge, Sasha can share any or all of the following information about herself if asked:

* She is Sasha Ivliskova, Strahd’s first and eldest bride. He wed her nearly four centuries ago, in the wake of the loss of his first love, Tatyana Federovna. He grew tired of her, however, and when she dared challenge him, he locked her away in a crypt for four hundred years, freeing her for unknown purposes shortly after his recent awakening. (If asked what the experience was like, Sasha says dully, “it was maddening—and a time that I wish to forget forever.”)
* She despises Strahd with every fiber of her being. “I am old, and I am tired,” she hisses. “There are two things I wish to see before I die: the light of the rising sun, and the death of the monster Strahd von Zarovich.”

If the players don't reveal their interest in infiltrating Castle Ravenloft, Sasha asks them outright if they approached her because they wish to steal from the castle. In either case, she is willing to share information about the castle’s contents, layout, and inhabitants—as well as a time when Strahd will be away from the keep—if the players agree to take a certain prisoner with them when they do. “Her name is Gertruda,” Sasha says, her brows furrowed in worry. “She is a villager from Barovia, spirited away as she trod the road toward Vallaki. She is alive, for now, but I fear for her life should she linger any longer in the keep. She's asked me to help free her, if I can—a request that, until now, I had no hope of fulfilling."

If the players agree to rescue Gertruda, Sasha can share the following information about Castle Ravenloft:

* Ever since his awakening, Strahd has departed the castle once each fortnight atop his **nightmare** steed Beucephalus on the night of the new moon. Sasha doesn’t know where he goes, or what he does, but she knows that he doesn’t return until the morning’s first light. Sasha can further share that the next new moon is tomorrow night—and that she has no reason to believe that Strahd won’t repeat the pattern again.
* Gertruda is a prisoner on the third floor of the castle, in the king’s suites. The players can access the suites via the staircase in the foyer (<span class="citation">K21. South Tower Stair, p. 59</span>).
* Sasha doesn’t know any of the traps that Strahd or his servants might have set in the castle. She does know, however, that the inside of the keep is often patrolled by undead **wights**—the animated remains of those that once guarded the castle.
* Strahd keeps prisoners in the dungeons, on the floor beneath the castle larders. The players can access the dungeons via the staircase in the foyer (<span class="citation">K21. South Tower Stair, p. 59</span>).
* Sasha has seen a dragon’s skull once—in a basement chamber that Volenta has more recently transformed into an ossuary. The chamber is behind the closed wooden doors to the west of <span class="citation">K65. Kitchen (p. 78)</span>.
* Although she hasn’t descended there since Strahd freed her from her crypt, the castle catacombs are accessible via <span class="citation">K18. High Tower Staircase (p. 58)</span>.
* Strahd has commanded his spawn to report the presence of any intruders into the castle, and Sasha therefore can’t help the players enter the keep herself. However, she can share the existence of a second, rear servants’ entrance (<span class="citation">K23. Servants’ Entrance (p. 59)</span> into the castle via <span class="citation">K3. Servants’ Courtyard (p. 54)</span>, which allows access to the servants’ quarters and kitchens.
* Should the players require it while navigating the castle, Sasha recalls that Strahd's oldest password is "I come in Dostron's memory." She isn't sure who Dostron is, or whether Strahd still uses it as a password, but believes him arrogant enough to believe that none in the castle—other than Rahadin—is old enough to remember it. (Sasha doesn't know it, but the players can use this password to open both the *Tome of Strahd*, as described in [[Arc H - The Lost Soul]], and the *Daern's Instant Fortress* located in <span class="citation">K41. Treasury (p. 67)</span>).

Sasha warns the players that they likely won't be able to depart the castle without facing Rahadin, the castle chamberlain. "The master of the castle may be gone," she tells them, "but his right-hand man stalks the shadows of any who enter."

Sasha’s memory and knowledge of the castle is limited beyond this information, and she apologizes for any inability to answer the players’ additional questions.

As Sasha's conversation with the players comes to a close, there comes a knock at the door. Upon opening the door, the players are greeted by Rahadin, accompanied by Escher.

After dismissing Sasha, Rahadin warns the players that they are not to leave their chambers until morning, noting with a stern glower that “dark things” roam the castle at night—and that undue curiosity, in the home of his master, can be a fatal flaw. “To ensure your safety, Escher shall stand guard at your door through the night,” he adds, much to Escher's obvious resentment.

Before departing, Rahadin also produces a key from his pocket, which he uses to lock the players in the guest suite—again, “for their safety.” He will return to unlock the door, he promises, at the first light of morning.

> [!abstract]+ **Missing Players**
> If one or more players went wandering off while being led up <span class="citation">K21. South Tower Stair (p. 59)</span>, Rahadin’s gaze tightens as he silently counts the number of players present as he moves to depart. Upon noticing that any of the players appears to be missing, he sharply asks where that player has gone. 
>
> If no answer is forthcoming, or if the player does not immediately present themselves, Rahadin icily commands the players to remain within their room, and not to “step a single toe out of line." He then departs to locate any missing players—"by force, if necessary."
>
> Unless a wandering player has made special effort to conceal their tracks, Rahadin swiftly tracks them down, locating them the first time (1) the player is reduced to 15 hit points or fewer in a combat encounter or (2) the player re-enters <span class="citation">K21. South Tower Stair (p. 59)</span> after exiting it.

A player who enters a trance or falls asleep while in the guest suite enters [[#O8. Varushka’s Nightmare]]. In addition, any non-undead, non-construct creature that remains in the guest suite for longer than an hour after dusk immediately falls unconscious and enters [[#O8. Varushka’s Nightmare]] below.

# O8. Varushka’s Nightmare

A player or allied NPC who falls unconscious in the lounge, guest room, or closet is mentally transported to Varushka’s Nightmare—a nightmare realm shaped by the spirit of one of Strahd’s first victims. 

Varushka's Nightmare exists across five near-identical copies of the Ravenloft guest suite, layered vertically atop one another. Within the Nightmare, the trapdoor in <span class="citation">K51.

This area is largely as described in <span class="citation">K49. Lounge (p. 70)</span>, <span class="citation">K50. Guest Room (p. 70)</span>, and <span class="citation">K51. Closet (p. 70)</span>.

As the players awake in the nightmare, read:

<div class="description">
<p>You awake in the guest suite. The room, however, is suffused with a gray, misty light, and the Guest Room's clock ticks with a sonorous echo.</p>
</div>
When the players first arrive in the Nightmare, they awaken in the same positions and locations as the ones in which they fell asleep or unconscious.

Shortly after the players regain their bearings, read:

<div class="description">
<p>Something heavy thumps against the closet door. Moments later, the clock on the wall strikes ten. With each sonorous chime, the miniature castle’s front gates swing open, unveiling an intricate ironwrought bat whose tiny wings repeatedly unfurl and collapse.</p>
<p>As the final chime fades, each of you feels two cold, sharp pressures prick against the flesh of your necks, which quickly give way to a strange, tingling numbness.</p>
</div>

The players then suffer the effects of **The Chiming Clock** below.

> [!info]+ **The Chiming Clock**
> The clock chimes on each hour. Each time the clock chimes the hour, each player must immediately make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking 7 (2d6) necrotic damage on a failure or half as much on a success. A player who takes this damage has their hit point maximum reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken. The reduction lasts until the player finishes a long rest.  A character whose maximum hit points is reduced to 0 this way vanishes from the nightmare, their soul taken from their body until the players either defeat or redeem the spirit of Varushka in [[#O8g. Escaping the Nightmare]].
>
> The clock continues to chime on the hour, even if damaged or destroyed. If cast out of a window or otherwise removed from the guest suite, it reappears in its original place on the wall in perfect condition shortly thereafter.
> 
> An hour passes each time the players take a short rest.

If a player investigates the closet, read:

<div class="description">
<p>A woman’s corpse dangles from an improvised noose crafted of torn fabric, which hangs from a black iron hook at the center of the far wall. Three feet above the hook, a wooden trapdoor hangs open on rusted metal hinges.</p>
</div>

The dead woman’s corpse is brown-haired, short, and freckled. She wears a plain, white wool dress and apron. A player who inspects her body finds a pair of puncture marks on her neck.

> [!info]+ **Speak With Dead**
> Players who cast *speak with dead* on Varushka's corpse can learn the same information as in [[#O8e. The Fifth Level]]. Varushka's corpse can also share that she committed suicide by hanging when she realized Strahd would never let her go free.

A player who ascends through the trapdoor emerges in <span class="citation">K47. Portrait of Strahd (p. 68)</span> on [[#O8b. The Second Level]].

> [!info]+ **A Haunting Loop**
> Instead of leading to <span class="citation">K55. Element Room (p. 72)</span>, the trapdoor in the Nightmare always leads to the trapdoor exit in <span class="citation">K47. Portrait of Strahd (p. 68)</span>. In addition, for as long as the players remain in the Nightmare, the **rug of smothering** and **portrait of Strahd** in <span class="citation">K47. Portrait of Strahd (p. 68)</span> are inanimate objects and don’t attack the players.
> 
> Each time the players emerge through the trapdoor, the area is largely as described in <span class="citation">K47. Portrait of Strahd (p. 68)</span>. However, the entryways to both <span class="citation">K21. South Tower Stair (p. 59)</span> and <span class="citation">K48. Offstair (p. 70)</span> have been bricked up, preventing the players from ascending or descending further into the castle.

If a player investigates the door in the lounge that exits into <span class="citation">K47. Portrait of Strahd (p. 68)</span>, they find that the door is locked, its lock replaced with an ornate golden keyhole. The door can’t be broken down, and the lock can’t be picked.

> [!info]+ **Ascending and Descending Floors**
> Players are able to descend to previous levels if they choose to do so, until they find the ornate golden key in [[#O8f. The Bloody Keep]]. Once they do, any attempts to descend to a previous level will return them to [[#O8a. The First Level]].

![[IsmarkGreat_transparent.png]]

<span class="credit">"Ismark the Great" by Caleb Cleveland. Support him on <a href="https://patreon.com/calebisdrawing/">Patreon!</a></span>

The man is a memory of Ismark Antonovich (Ismark the Great), and appears strangely familiar to any player who’s previously seen the statue of Ismark the Great in the Barovian village square. The raven on his shoulder is a memory of the **wereraven** Livius Martikov, the founder of the Keepers of the Feather.

Ismark is startled, but “gladly surprised" to see other living mortals in the castle. He introduces himself as Ismark Antonovich, and the raven on his shoulder as Livius. As introductions proceed, he notes that the players “don’t look like they’re from around here," but thinks aloud that it’s not uncommon for outsiders to be swept away into Barovia by the Mists.

Ismark, who has the statistics of a **veteran** and is a friendly, gregarious man, is willing to share the following information if asked:

* He is from the nearby village of Barovia, which lies in the shadow of Castle Ravenloft. Their homes have been preyed upon in recent years by a nest of vampire spawn, whose master slumbers in the depths of this keep.
* The raven on his shoulder is named Livius, and has been Ismark’s “loyal companion" in this venture into the castle. Ismark is also joined in this expedition by a woman named Lugdana—a mighty warrior—from whom he has become temporarily separated. (If asked, Ismark can share that Lugdana was caught by some kind of trap while in the midst of a duel with a pair of **wights** in the castle cellar. “The floor swept up around her, and carried her away up into the heights of the castle," he recalls worriedly. “I’ve seen no sign of her yet, but I hope that she’s managed to find safety somewhere in these towers.")
* Ismark and Lugdana came here in search of the *Sigil of the Sun*, a magic item said to empower those who fight the undead. If asked, Ismark describes the *Sigil* as a platinum amulet shaped like the sun, with a large ruby crystal embedded in its center. (Ismark has never heard of the *Holy Symbol of Ravenkind*. If shown the _Holy Symbol_, Ismark recognizes it as matching the description of the _Sigil_, and tells the players to keep it close as they make their escape from the castle.)

Ismark is interested in exploring the guest suite for any signs of Lugdana, and invites the players to join him in doing so. “Strength in numbers, yes?" he asks, winking.

The guest suite is largely as described in <span class="citation">K49. Lounge (p. 70)</span>, <span class="citation">K50. Guest Room (p. 70)</span>, and <span class="citation">K51. Closet (p. 70)</span>. However, one of the tables in the Lounge holds two silver goblets, which are as described in <span class="citation">Unseen Servant (p. 51)</span>.

In addition, when a creature first attempts to open the Closet door, the following objects in the Guest Room animate and attack, using the statistics for animated objects given on <span class="citation">Player’s Handbook, p. 213</span> except where given otherwise: 

* the four-poster bed (**large animated object**), 
* the two chairs (**medium animated objects**), 
* the ottoman (**small animated object**), and 
* the rug (**rug of smothering**, <span class="citation">Player’s Handbook, p. 20</span>, with 63 hit points, a Strength score of 18 (+4), +5 to hit, an escape DC of 14, and dealing 18 (4d6 + 4) damage on a hit).

Ismark and Livius fight alongside the players if present, Livius remaining in his **raven** form. (Because he's carrying a torch, Ismark can't use his shortsword, and must wield his longsword one-handed.)

When the players successfully reach and open the trapdoor, Ismark bids them farewell and wishes them luck on their journey, noting that he will seek Lugdana elsewhere. 

A player who ascends through the trapdoor emerges in <span class="citation">K47. Portrait of Strahd (p. 68)</span> in the corresponding section of [[#O8c. The Third Level]].

This area is largely as described in <span class="citation">K49. Lounge (p. 70)</span>, <span class="citation">K50. Guest Room (p. 70)</span>, and <span class="citation">K51. Closet (p. 70)</span>. This area looks somewhat run-down, but free of much of the grime and age that marked the lower levels. In addition, the door leading to <span class="citation">K49. Lounge (p. 70)</span> lacks the ornate gold lock from [[#O8a. The First Level]].

Any player who enters the Guest Room immediately notices a quiet, persistent ticking noise deeper and more resonant than that of the clock. A player who listens closely to the noise can discern that it appears to be emanating from beneath the bed. A player who looks beneath the bed or otherwise disturbs its contents encounters Pidlwick II, who is as described in <span class="citation">K59. High Tower Peak (p. 73)</span>.

A player who opens the closet door finds that the hook that opens the trapdoor has been unscrewed and removed from its socket. Although it can’t speak, Pidlwick II can use simple nods, gestures, and diagrams to communicate that it has hidden the hook somewhere in the guest suite. However, because Pidlwick II is lonely and wants to play a game, it won’t initially share where the hook is hidden. However, if asked, it tilts its head to the side and looks thoughtful, as if it’s listening for something.

Pidlwick II has hidden the hook in the guest room clock. A player who spends 1 minute searching the clock for secrets and succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check finds a hidden storage compartment in the portion of the clock corresponding to the castle’s north tower, which ordinarily holds <span class="citation">K20. Heart of Sorrow (p. 59)</span> and <span class="citation">K60. North Tower Peak (p. 74)</span>.

A player who treats Pidlwick II kindly and succeeds on a DC 12 Charisma (Persuasion) check can convince it to shyly point to the clock on the wall if asked for the hook’s location.

> [!abstract]+ **Threatening Pidlwick II**
> If a player threatens Pidlwick II and succeeds on a DC 10 Charisma (Intimidation) check, Pidlwick II shyly takes their hand and leads them toward <span class="citation">K47. Portrait of Strahd (p. 68)</span>. Through crude hand gestures, it beckons for them to stand directly before the bricked-up stone wall blocking access to <span class="citation">K21. South Tower Stair (p. 59)</span>. 
>
> If the player does so, it then attempts to push them down the stairs as described in <span class="citation">Pidlwick II (p. 73)</span>. A player who fails the Dexterity saving throw falls down one hundred feet of stairs before falling through the bricked-up stone wall blocking access to <span class="citation">K48. Offstair (p. 70)</span>, taking damage as described in <span class="citation">K59. High Tower Peak (p. 73)</span>. Whether the player succeeds or fails, Pidlwick II then immediately vanishes from sight, leaving behind a faint sound of tinny, clanking metal that sounds almost like laughter. The sound soon fades into silence.
> 
> Once Pidlwick has vanished and the sound of his own clockwork mechanism has disappeared, a player who returns to <span class="citation">K50. Guest Room (p. 70)</span> can hear that the sound of the guest room clock is tinnier and less resonant than on other levels. (This is caused by the presence of the hook, which dampens the sound of the clock's internal clockwork.) A player who then inspects the clock finds the hidden storage compartment automatically.

The trapdoor leads to a copy of the guest suite largely as described in <span class="citation">K49. Lounge (p. 70)</span>, <span class="citation">K50. Guest Room (p. 70)</span>, and <span class="citation">K51. Closet (p. 70)</span>. This area looks somewhat run-down, but free of much of the grime and age that marked the upper levels. In addition, the door leading to <span class="citation">K49. Lounge (p. 70)</span> lacks the ornate gold lock from [[Arc O - Dinner with the Devil#O8a. The First Level|The First Level]].

Instead of opening into the closet, the closet door in the guest suite opens into a blank stone wall. When the closet door is opened for the first time, the southwestern windows in the Lounge slam open, allowing the storm to howl inside and revealing a copy of the castle rooftop, which is largely as described in <span class="citation">K53. Rooftop (p. 71)</span>. However, the remainder of the castle is absent, leaving the rooftops surrounded only by an endless, misty void. When a character first looks out the window, read:

<div class="description">
<p>The window opens onto a long, dark rooftop cloaked in swirling mists. Rain splashes against the sagging, sloping roof as flashes of lightning illuminate gargoyles perched on the roof’s end peaks, their hideous stares forever fixed on the dark, endless chasm below. On the far side of the rooftop, a small, dark, open closet stands quietly on a parapet amidst the storm.</p>
</div>

A character attempting to cross the rooftop must make a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. If the check succeeds, the character moves at half speed across the rooftop. On a check result of 6-9, the character neither gains nor loses ground; on a result of 5 or less, the character falls and takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage, falling 15 feet to a ledge that runs beneath the edge of the roof. To climb back to the roof from the ledge, a character must succeed on a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.

When all players have exited the window, six **swarms of bats** descend to attack any characters that haven't yet reached the far side. Characters have disadvantage on checks made to cross the roof while sharing a space with a swarm of bats. If any character is concentrating on a spell that allows flight, three **swarms of bats** attack that character simultaneously, hoping to break their concentration.

On initiative count 20 of the first round after the **swarms of bats** descend, an **adult black dragon** begins stalking the players from <span class="citation">K47. Portrait of Strahd (p. 68)</span>. Read:

<div class="description">
<p>A deep rumble reverberates through stonework of the castle, the rooftop shaking as tiles tremble and slide down into the endless abyss below. A chorus of a thousand screams echoes in the distance, but slowly growing closer.</p> 
<p>Something enormous thuds against the stone of the landing outside of the guest suite. As you watch, a massive, clawed, reptilian hand curls slowly around the doorframe, the wood splintering as the stone crumbles beneath it.</p>
</div>

The dragon is a symbolic representation of Rahadin, who served as the warden to the women Strahd lured to and trapped in the castle. Any creature that has previously heard Rahadin's ***deathly chorus*** recognizes that the screams resemble the same manifestation.

Make the following changes to the dragon's statistics:

* A creature that fails its saving throw against the dragon's ***frightful presence*** feature by 5 or more is paralyzed until the end of its next turn.
* A creature that fails its saving throw against the dragon's ***acid breath*** takes no damage. Instead, the acid transforms into an writhing tangle of jewel-encrusted gold chains, which restrain the target until the end of its next turn. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw has its legs partially wrapped by the chains, and is slowed until the end of its next turn. (A slowed creature must spend 1 extra foot of movement for every foot it moves using its speed, grants advantage on attack rolls against it, and has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.)
* The dragon can't use legendary actions.

A creature ensnared by the dragon's chains notices that they're not chains at all, but thousands of interlocking golden rings, bracelets, and necklaces. Each set of chains has AC 15, 20 hit points, immunity to piercing, psychic, and poison damage, and vulnerability to fire damage, and can be broken with a successful DC 15 Strength check.

The dragon, which acts on initiative count 0 of each round, acts as follows:

**On its first turn**, it uses its ***frightful presence*** feature, but doesn't move through the door.

**On its second turn**, it begins squeezing through the guest suite door, then uses its ***acid breath***, hitting any players less than halfway across the rooftop. Read:

<div class="description">
<p>A piercing chorus of screams builds as a monstrous, black-scaled, reptilian head pushes into the suite, its skull alone just as wide and half as tall as the doorframe itself. A long, wicked scar cuts across its forehead. Horns resembling pointed, elfin ears thrust up from the sides of its head, and its eyes glimmer with cruel, malevolent purpose.</p>
<p>Slowly, it begins to thrust its broad, muscled shoulders through the guest suite doorway, the ancient stonework cracking beneath its ponderous bulk. As it does, its serpentine neck coils, its chest swelling grotesquely as its scales stretch and bulge.</p>
<p>
<p>A guttural growl builds deep in its throat, rising to an ear-splitting roar as the beast's maw gapes wide, revealing row upon row of needle-sharp teeth. A torrent of purple-black acid erupts from the dragon's jaws, filling the air with an acrid, caustic stench.</p>
</div>

**On its third turn**, the dragon enters the lounge and roars, shattering the glass in all west-facing windows. If its ***acid breath*** has recharged, it uses it again; otherwise, it attempts to squeeze through the windows, then stalk across the rooftops until it reaches a target for its ***multiattack***, preferring to approach any characters that have fallen to the ledge below the roof.

The closet on the far side of the rooftop is a copy of the closet in <span class="citation">K51. Closet (p. 70)</span>, though without the cloak hanging from the hook. A player who ascends through the trapdoor emerges in <span class="citation">K47. Portrait of Strahd (p. 68)</span> in the corresponding section of [[#O8e. The Fifth Level]]. The dragon can't follow the players through the trapdoor.

This area is largely as described in <span class="citation">K49. Lounge (p. 70)</span> and <span class="citation">K50. Guest Room (p. 70)</span>. However, the castle’s stone is bright, clean, and freshly carved, with its furniture pristine and newly crafted. In addition, the door leading to <span class="citation">K49. Lounge (p. 70)</span> lacks the ornate gold lock from [[#O8a. The First Level]].

A character who approaches the guest room hears the sound of a woman’s quiet sobs emanating from within. When a player first enters the guest room, read:

<div class="description">
<p>A young woman sits atop the bed. She wears a simple white, woolen shift with a clean apron tied around her waist, and her messy brown bangs fall across her face. Her legs are held tight to her chest, her head buried in her knees as great sobs wrack her body. She appears to be clutching something in one of her hands.</p>
</div>

If a player speaks or otherwise interacts with the woman, read:

<div class="description">
<p>The woman’s sobs quiet, and she peers up at you over the top of her knees. Her eyes are red and blotchy, her freckled cheeks stained with tears. You can see now that the right neckline of her white dress is stained a dark, wet red, and two crimson puncture wounds mark the side of her neck. She releases her grip around the object in her palm, revealing a small, half-heart necklace made of tarnished silver that sags against her chest.</p>
</div>

The woman is a memory of the servant Varushka, as she was in the first days following the arrival of the Mists. Any player who saw the hanged corpse in [[#O8a. The First Level]] immediately recognizes her as the same woman.

If asked, Varushka can share the following information:

* She is Varushka, a servant of Castle Ravenloft. Until recently, she enjoyed her work. However, that changed ten days ago, "the day the sky turned red, and the mists rose around the valley." That morning, she saw "a great darkness" appear in King von Zarovich's chambers and speak to him. "He didn't see me, but I saw him as I cleaned," Varushka whispers. "Before I fled, I heard the whispering of a thousand voices—and saw a glimmer of amber in the air before him." 
* Since then, the lord of the castle has begun visiting her in private. “He has become a monster," Varushka chokes, clutching her knees tighter to her chest. While he hasn’t taken any physical liberties with her—a small grace she is thankful for—he has fed upon her multiple times like a bat, draining the blood from her neck. (If asked, Varushka can confirm that the lord of the castle is Strahd, though she’s too fearful to speak his name aloud.)
* When the lord first fed upon her, Varushka attempted to flee the keep, terrified for her life. Instead, however, she was apprehended and locked in the guest suite. “Rahadin, the chamberlain, keeps the key locked in his office desk, in the cellars far below us," she mourns. “There’s no chance I’ll ever escape." If asked, Varushka can inform the players that Rahadin’s office is close to the kitchens and servants’ hall, just past the guards’ meeting room and the kingsmen hall. (Varushka is referring to the chambers described in <span class="citation">K67. Hall of Bones (p. 78)</span> and <span class="citation">K70. Kingsmen Hall (p. 79)</span>.)
* Since Varushka’s imprisonment, the lord has visited her nightly to drink his fill. She now believes that there is no escape from her ultimate fate—but is determined to deny him the opportunity to turn her into a monster like him.
* The half-locket was a gift from a "dear friend" of hers, named Katarina. ("I don't think I'll ever see her again, though," Varushka hiccups.) If asked about Katarina, Varushka looks sad, and shares only that she was someone with whom Varushka once thought she might share a future, though she knows that now to be impossible.

Varushka can’t leave the guest suite. If shown the exit, she regards it as a locked and closed door; if pushed through it, an invisible force painfully stops her from leaving.

Varushka isn’t sure why the players have appeared in her chambers, though she’s grateful for any comfort or reassurances they might provide to her. If the players treat her kindly and tell her that they wish to enter her closet, she warns them that “he" lurks there, “bloody and hungry, and filled with grief and rage and hate." (There is no doubt from the tone of her voice that she is referring to Strahd.) If the players move to enter the closet, she warns them that he is “young, and weaker than he may become," but that he is still a foe to be feared.

The closet door doesn’t open into the guest suite closet. Instead, a player who opens the closet door emerges into <span class="citation">K23. Servants’ Entrance (p. 59)</span>, as described in [[#O8f. The Bloody Keep]] below.

> [!abstract]+ **Katarina’s Necklace**
> If a player offers Varushka Katarina’s half of the two-piece necklace obtained in [[#O3b. The Rider’s Guidance]], Varushka is delighted to see it, but declines to accept it. “I think there is someone else who needs it more," she says softly, though she isn’t sure who that person might be.

A player who passes through the closet door in [[#O8e. The Fifth Level]] emerges into <span class="citation">K23. Servants’ Entrance (p. 59)</span>, as it was on the day of Strahd’s death nearly four centuries ago. Read:

<div class="description">
<p>Blood-red light streams in through a window on the east wall. A large, heavy table stands in the center of the floor, half-covered in a puddle of black ink from an overturned inkwell. A bloody dagger has been plunged into the pages of a thick book beside the inkwell, and a man’s corpse lies slumped against the leg of the table just beneath it.</p>
<p>There is a splintered door in the north wall, and a staircase in the south wall that plunges into darkness. The sounds of distant screams echo from the space below.</p>
</div>

A player who looks out of the window perceives nothing but an endless, blood-red void. (The door the players entered from still leads back into the guest suite closet.)

The corpse is clad in a guard’s chain-mail armor. His snapped wooden spear lies discarded on the stones beneath the table not far away. A player who inspects the corpse can discern that his throat was torn open. A successful DC 14 Wisdom (Medicine) check reveals that the man’s flesh was ripped by long, fine claws.

The splintered door leads into the Servants’ Rooms (see below). The staircase descends to the Castle Cellar (see below).

If the heart is reduced to 0 hit points, it shatters, and its crystal shards transform into blood, which rains down on the tower interior and staircase. The destruction of the Heart of Sorrow causes the tower to stop shuddering, and the interior of the tower becomes dark. Destroying the heart earns the characters 1,500 XP.

#### Servants’ Quarters
A player who passes through the splintered door emerges into <span class="citation">K24. Servants’ Quarters (p. 61)</span>, as it was on the day of Strahd’s death nearly four centuries ago. Read:

<div class="description">
<p>Crimson light from the windows illuminates a tidy room containing several pieces of simple furniture, including a writing desk, a dozen wooden chairs, and a pair of tables decorated with floral-pattern tablecloths. A narrow staircase with a wooden railing ascends along the north wall.</p>
</div>

A player with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 10 or greater notices something trembling beneath the tablecloth of the far table. A player who pulls aside the tablecloth reveals Varushka, who is wide-eyed, pale, and obviously terrified. She doesn’t recognize the players, and whispers fearfully for them to “leave her alone" and “flee for their own lives." 

Varushka will not willingly leave her hiding place beneath the table. However, if questioned, Varushka tells them that if they’re searching for “Captain Dilisnya," they’re too late—he just fled down the stairs and escaped outside into the castle courtyard. (Varushka is referring to [[History of Barovia#Arrival of the Mists|Leo Dilisnya]], the captain of Strahd’s guard. She’s bewildered by how he came to be in the servants’ upper quarters—given that she last saw him descending the stairs to the servants' hall—but hasn’t spared the time to think about it too closely, given that the whole world seems to have fallen into insanity.)

Varushka is too terrified to share any information other than that “King Strahd" has gone mad, and is currently rampaging through the lower floors of the castle. “The skies have turned red," she sobs. “Are we all going to die?"
#### Servants’ Upper Floor
A player who ascends the stairs from the [[#Servants’ Quarters]] emerges into <span class="citation">K34. Servants’ Upper Floor (p. 64)</span>, as it was on the day of Strahd’s death nearly four centuries ago. Read:

<div class="description">
<p>Neat rows of small, tidy cots line the left-hand side of this upstairs room. A tall, dusty wardrobe roughly shaped like a coffin, its black doors painted with fey creatures, stands between two full-length mirrors hanging on the south wall. One of the mirrors hangs slightly askew.</p>
</div>

The mirror conceals the secret door described in <span class="citation">K34. Servants’ Upper Floor (p. 64)</span>. It can be pulled open to reveal a small, empty closet that contains a wooden ladder as described in <span class="citation">K34. Servants’ Upper Floor (p. 64)</span>.
#### North Tower
A player who passes through the secret door emerges into <span class="citation">K20. Heart of Sorrow (p. 59)</span>, as it was on the day of Strahd’s death nearly four centuries ago. Read:

<div class="description">
<p>A yawning, blood-red void surrounds the shattered remains of a once-mighty tower. Above you, shards of pulverized stone drift helplessly through the air, marking the silhouette where a spiral staircase might once have risen into the heights above.</p>
<p>Below you, dark stone steps descend to a mosaic floor, hugging the outer wall of the ruined tower. In the center of the room below, another set of stairs leads further down.</p>
</div>

The lack of stairs makes further ascent in the ruined tower impossible. A player who descends the stairs finds that the corridor leading to <span class="citation">K13. Turret Post Access Hall (p. 57)</span> has partially collapsed, blocking further exploration beyond the corridor’s midpoint.

The second set of stairs below is as described in <span class="citation">K20a. Tower Hall Stair (p. 59)</span>, and forms a loop with the [[#Castle Cellar]] via <span class="citation">K71. Kingsmen Quarters (p. 79)</span>.
### Castle Cellar
#### Servants’ Hall
A player who descends the stairs from <span class="citation">K23. Servants' Entrance (p. 59)</span> emerges into <span class="citation">K62. Servants’ Hall (p. 76)</span>, as it was on the day of Strahd’s death nearly four centuries ago. Read:

<div class="description">
<p>A final scream is cut abruptly silent as you descend the stone stairs. Three corpses clad in bloodied chain mail litter this long hall. The doors to the left and right stand closed, though the twin heavy double doors at the end of the hall have been thrown open. The upper torso of an additional corpse lies slumped at the base of a long, bloody smear along the right-side door, its severed legs discarded along the floor several feet away.</p>
</div>

The corridor beyond the left-side door leading to <span class="citation">K61. Elevator Trap (p. 74)</span> has been bricked up and is currently inaccessible. The remaining rooms in this area are as follows:

* ***Wine Cellar.*** The wine cellar is largely as described in <span class="citation">K63. Wine Cellar (p. 77)</span>, but the casks are fresh and new, with no rats present.
* ***Kitchen.*** The kitchen is largely as described in <span class="citation">K65. Kitchen (p. 78)</span>, but with no odor of decay, no pot bubbling over the fire pit, and the fire pit unlit.
* ***Butler’s Quarters.*** The butler’s quarters are largely as described in <span class="citation">K66. Butler’s Quarters (p. 78)</span>, but contains only a neat, primly made bed and a chest of drawers filled with clean and pressed tunics, slacks, and undergarments.
#### Guards’ Meeting Room
A player who passes through the double doors at the end of the servants’ hall emerges into <span class="citation">K67. Hall of Bones (p. 78)</span>, as it was on the day of Strahd’s death nearly four centuries ago. Read:

<div class="description">
<p>You emerge from the door into a scene of bloodstained carnage. Red pools cover the floor of this area, which is further littered by a half-dozen broken corpses. Large oak tables, scarred and beaten, lay scattered like toys about the room, their wood crushed and splintered. Above the eastern doors is mounted the skull of a dragon.</p>
<p>A door stands closed to the south. To the north, a second door hangs slightly ajar.</p>
</div>

If the players haven’t previously encountered Strahd, add:

<div class="description">
<p>A man’s voice roars out from beyond the half-open door: “Coward! Traitor! Reveal yourself, Dilisnya, and I may grant you a quick death like the others. Linger, and I will see that your suffering lasts for <em>centuries</em>."</p>
</div>

The voice is recognizable as Strahd’s, but more full of emotion and life.

The corridor beyond the southern door leading to <span class="citation">K68. Guards’ Run (p. 79)</span> has been bricked up and is currently inaccessible.
#### Kingsmen Hall & Quarters
***Kingsmen Hall.*** A player who passes through the half-open door at the northern end of the guards’ meeting hall, or who enters via the kingsmen quarters (see below), emerges into <span class="citation">K70. Kingsmen Hall (p. 79)</span>, as it was on the day of Strahd’s death nearly four centuries ago. Read:

<div class="description">
<p>This thirty-foot-square room is a shambles. Scattered furniture lies in heaps near the walls. Broken and bloody corpses lie scattered across the floor, many bearing crumpled and crushed plate armor. Shields and swords jut from the walls as if driven into them by some tremendous force.</p>
<p>Two doors stand opposite one another in the center of the north wall and the south wall. A dark archway leads out through the east wall.</p>
</div>

At the time the players first arrive, this chamber is currently inhabited by a memory of Strahd von Zarovich. If he is present when the players first enter, read:

<div class="description">
<p>A tall, bloody figure stands amidst the carnage—Strahd. His once-pristine attire is marred with bloody stains, splatters of viscera painting a gruesome tableau across his clothes and skin. His pale, near-translucent flesh contrasts sharply with the dark, dripping red that stains his trembling hands, each finger tipped with a long, bloodied claw. Beneath his blood-matted hair, his red eyes burn with a feral glow, his batlike nostrils twitching madly.</p>
<p>A wounded guard spasms in Strahd’s grasp, then abruptly goes limp as the vampire’s fangs sink deep into his bare, crimson neck. Blood spills from the man’s throat as Strahd drinks greedily, rivulets of blood running down his chest and clothes.</p>
</div>

> [!info]+ **Memory of Strahd**
> This memory of Strahd has the statistics described in <span class="citation">Strahd von Zarovich (p. 240)</span>, but without the ***spellcasting*** feature, ***charm*** feature, ***children of the night*** feature, or any lair actions. In addition, instead of legendary actions, Strahd can take up to three reactions per round, but only one per turn. (If Strahd would lose his reactions and isn’t incapacitated, he loses one reaction instead.) He also gains the following reactions:
>
> * ***Move.*** In response to taking damage from a ranged spell or ability, Strahd moves up to his speed without provoking opportunity attacks toward the attacker.
> * ***Unarmed Strike.*** In response to a character within 5 feet hitting or missing him with an attack, Strahd makes one ***unarmed strike***.
> * ***Bite (Costs 2 Reactions).*** In response to a grappled character within 5 feet attacking him, casting a spell, or attempting to escape the grapple, Strahd makes one ***bite*** attack.
>
> If reduced to 0 hit points, Strahd uses his ***misty escape*** feature to transform into a cloud of mist. He then retreats through the crack in the wall described in <span class="citation">K63. Wine Cellar (p. 77)</span>.

Strahd doesn’t immediately notice players who merely peer into the room instead of entering it. In addition, while in the Nightmare, Strahd is bloodlusted and crazed with rage and grief. While in this state, he has disadvantage on Wisdom and Intelligence checks, reducing his passive Wisdom (Perception) score to 17.

The players can attempt to lure Strahd away from the door to the chamberlain’s office through magical or other means. If the players fail to hide from him or otherwise reveal themselves, Strahd snarls, “More traitors? I’ll deal with you as I did the last—and soon enough, your ringleader will join you." 

A player who then tells Strahd of Leo Dilisnya’s whereabouts and succeeds on a DC 20 Charisma (Persuasion) check can convince Strahd to allow them and their companions to live. Otherwise, Strahd attacks them on sight, pursuing them wherever they go in the castle. However, if the players retreat into [[#O8e. The Fifth Level]] and close the door, Strahd can’t follow them inside.

***Kingsmen Quarters.*** A player who passes through the archway in the kingsmen hall or descends <span class="citation">K20a. Tower Hall Stair (p. 59)</span> from [[#North Tower]] emerges into <span class="citation">K71. Kingsmen Quarters (p. 79)</span>, as it was on the day of Strahd’s death nearly four centuries ago. Read:

<div class="description">
<p>This dark passage runs for twenty feet, connecting an archway to the west with an ascending stone staircase to the east. To the north and south are ten-foot-square alcoves cluttered with cots and fine rugs.</p>
</div>

If the players haven’t previously encountered Strahd, add:

<div class="description">
<p>A man’s voice roars out from beyond the archway: “Coward! Traitor! Reveal yourself, Dilisnya, and I may grant you a quick death like the others. Linger, and I will see that your suffering lasts for <em>centuries</em>."</p>
</div>

The voice is recognizable as Strahd’s, but more full of emotion and life.
#### Chamberlain’s Office
Rahadin’s office is largely as described in <span class="citation">K72. Chamberlain’s Office (p. 79)</span>, except Rahadin and the **shadow demon** are not present, and players who uncover the secret door find that it has been bricked up.

In addition, an ornate golden key that matches the pattern of the guest room keyhole lies upon the table. The key unlocks the locked door to the lounge in [[#O8a. The First Level]].
## O8g. Escaping the Nightmare
The first time the players exit [[#O8f. The Bloody Keep]] after obtaining the guest room key, they emerge from the closet door directly into the guest room of [[#O8a. The First Level]].  However, Varushka’s corpse and noose are no longer present in the closet.

The first time a player attempts to turn the guest room key in the ornate gold lock of the door leading from <span class="citation">K49. Lounge (p. 70)</span> to <span class="citation">K47. Portrait of Strahd (p. 68)</span>, the key half-turns, then sticks in the lock. A heartbeat later, sharp spikes burst from the metal of the keyhole, forcing that player to succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 2d4 points of piercing damage. The guest-room clock then chimes again, causing the players to once more suffer the effects of **The Chiming Clock** (see above).

A moment after the clock chimes, the spirit of Varushka appears behind the players. Read:

<div class="description">
<p>Your breath fogs in the air as the temperature plummets, a cold frost creeping across the door’s metal hinges and handle. As a shadow falls across the carpeted floor from behind you, you can hear the sound of a woman’s low, rasping breaths just over your shoulder.</p>
</div>

Any player who turns around or is already facing her beholds Varushka’s present-day form. Read:

<div class="description">
<p>A spectral figure hovers in the air before you—a woman. Her once-white dress is stained with blood, its tattered scraps fluttering like ghostly ribbons in the air behind her. Her hair whips about in a chill, unearthly wind, her tearful eyes blazing with rage and grief. A long, rough scar cuts across the flesh beneath her chin, just above a cascade of blood that seeps eternally from the twin puncture wounds that mark her neck. A necklace hangs from a thin silver cord around her neck, pulled so tight it bites deeply into the skin.</p>
<p>She stretches out her hands toward you and whispers hoarsely, “<em>No one leaves</em>." In the distance, the guest-room clock begins to chime once more—and a familiar numb sensation begins to pierce through the flesh of your necks.</p>
</div>

![[Varushka.png]]

If the players previously obtained Katarina’s necklace in [[#O3b. The Rider’s Guidance]], a player who inspects Varushka’s necklace recognizes it as the matching half of the pair.

Once Varushka appears, the guest-room clock chimes once each in-game minute, causing the players to once again suffer the effects of **The Chiming Clock** (see above).

Varushka freely shares that she has taken the players as her prisoners, as she has to all who seek the rest she’s been denied. “You may have found the key where I buried it," she snarls, tears streaming down her cheeks, “but so long as my soul lingers here, I will *never* set you free."

If the players attack Varushka, proceed to [[#Varushka’s Rage]] below. If the players attempt to negotiate with Varushka, proceed to [[#Varushka’s Grief]] instead.
### Varushka’s Grief
The players can attempt to persuade Varushka to allow them to leave by making any reasonable argument and succeeding on a DC 10 Charisma (Persuasion) check, made with advantage if the players comforted the memory of Varushka in [[#O8e. The Fifth Level]]. The check succeeds automatically if the players inform Varushka that they hold Katarina’s half of her necklace.

Whether the check succeeds or fails, read:

<div class="description">
<p>The very room seems to warp and bend around the spirit, the walls bleeding shadows that reach out like fingers to embrace her. As you watch, a nimbus of cold, umbral darkness forms around her, and her eyes darken to a deep, voidlike black.</p>
</div>

Varushka then angrily counters the players’ argument. (For example, if the players showed her Katarina’s necklace, she insists that they’re lying to her, and the necklace is fake.) If the players’ first Charisma (Persuasion) check was successful, Varushka is uncertain about her response, and a player with a passive Wisdom (Insight) score of 13 or greater recognizes that her defiance is half-hearted and tinged with self-doubt.

As Varushka counters the players’ argument, if any player has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 13 or greater, add:

<div class="description">
<p>As you observe the halo of shadows surrounding her, you notice that it seems to be not a single shadow, but an assembly of countless overlapping amorphous, indistinct silhouettes. Though Varushka makes no move to acknowledge or recognize their presence, they whisper incessantly into her ears, their cold, hollow voices seeming to darken the room further with every word.</p>
</div>

A player who asks Varushka or succeeds in a DC 13 Wisdom (Insight) check learns that Varushka neither perceives the silhouettes nor realizes that they’re there. A player who approaches Varushka or who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check can make out a few words and phrases from the cacophony of whispers:

* “They’ll leave you, just like her."
* “Why should they escape your fate?"
* “He took so much from you. This is what you’re owed."

> [!lore]+ **Dark Whispers**
> The whispering shadows are a manifestation of the [[Lore of Barovia#Dark Powers|Dark Powers]]. Eager to remove Ireena Kolyana from the players’ influence and protection, they have reached out to embrace Varushka’s spirit to dissuade her from allowing the players to escape from her Nightmare.

The players can again attempt to persuade Varushka to free them by making any reasonable argument and succeeding on a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check. The check is made with disadvantage if the players failed the first Charisma (Persuasion) check. Otherwise, the check is made with advantage if the players’ arguments directly rebut the Dark Powers’ whispers, and succeeds automatically if the players present Varushka with Katarina’s note or its contents.

If the players succeed on this check, Varushka tearfully relinquishes her supernatural grasp on the key and allows the players to depart. If the players fail the check instead, Varushka attacks. (See [[#Varushka’s Rage]] below).

If the players offer Varushka the necklace, she thanks them but declines to keep it. Mournfully, she asks the players to find Katarina if she still lives, or find her grave, asking them to "Keep it in her memory."

<p><strong><em>Legendary Resistance (1/day).</em></strong> If Varushka would fail a saving throw, she can choose to succeed instead.</p>
<p><strong><em>Incorporeal Movement.</em></strong> Varushka can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. She takes 5 (1d10) force damage if she ends her turn inside an object.
<p><strong><em>Overwhelming Despair.</em></strong> When Varushka drops to 0 hit points, her sclera darken and a shroud of swirling mist and whispering shadows surrounds her. Her statistics are then instantly replaced by the statistics of her second form. Her initiative count doesn't change. Excess damage doesn't carry over to her new form, but she retains any conditions she had in her previous form.</p>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> Varushka uses <strong><em>warp flesh</em></strong> twice. She can replace one or both with <strong><em>animate minor object.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Animate Minor Object.</em></strong> Varushka animates an undamaged Small or Medium object she can see within 30 feet for 1 minute or until the object is destroyed. The object becomes an <strong>animated minor object</strong> (see below). It acts on Varushka’s initiative, but takes its turn immediately after hers</p>
<p><strong><em>Animate Major Object (1/day).</em></strong> Varushka animates an undamaged Large object she can see within 30 feet for 1 minute or until the object is destroyed. The object becomes an <strong>animated major object</strong> (see below). It acts on Varushka’s initiative, but takes its turn immediately after hers.</p>
<p><strong><em>Warp Flesh.</em></strong> Varushka forces one creature she can see within 30 feet to make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the target takes 12 (2d8 + 3) necrotic damage and Varushka can cause its arms or legs to warp grotesquely until the start of her next turn. (A creature with warped arms can’t crawl, makes weapon attacks with disadvantage, and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw each time it attempts to cast a spell with somatic components or lose the spell. A creature with warped legs falls prone.)</p>
<h3>Bonus Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Stonemelt.</em></strong> Varushka turns the floor around her within 5 feet into quicksand (Dungeon Master’s Guide, p. 110) for 1 minute. A 5-foot square area turned into quicksand in this way immediately ceases to be quicksand if no creature is sunk into it.</p>
<p><strong><em>Papercut.</em></strong> Varushka tears the pages from the books in the Lounge and creates a whirlwind of slicing paper centered on a point she can see within 30 feet. Each creature in a 5-foot-radius, 15-foot-tall cylinder centered on that point must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 18 (4d8) slashing damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Horrific Visage (1/day).</em></strong> Each non-undead creature within 60 feet of Varushka that can see her must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the start of Varushka’s next turn. If a target’s save fails by 5 or more, the target is also turned while frightened in this way. (A turned creature must take the Dash action and move away from the source of its fear by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move.)</p>
<h3>Reactions</h3>
<p>Varushka can take up to three reactions per round, but only one per turn. If she would lose her reactions and isn't incapacitated, she loses one reaction instead.</p>
<p><strong><em>Swap.</em></strong> In response to being targeted by an attack or spell, or by being placed in a spell’s area of effect, Varushka forces a creature she can see within 30 feet other than the attacker or caster to make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, she and the target switch places, and the target suffers the effects of the attack or spell instead.</p>
<p><strong><em>Adhere.</em></strong> In response to being missed by a melee attack, Varushka forces the creature to make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failure, the weapon or limb used in the attack is adhered to a nearby surface until the start of Varushka’s next turn.</p>
<p><strong><em>Erupt (1/day).</em></strong> In response to being reduced to 0 hit points, Varushka forces each creature within 30 feet to succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or take 11 (2d10) force damage and be pushed 20 feet away. If the target can’t move the full distance, it takes an additional 1d6 bludgeoning damage for each 5 feet not moved and falls prone.</p>

<p><strong><em>Incorporeal Movement.</em></strong> Varushka can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. She takes 5 (1d10) force damage if she ends her turn inside an object.
<h3>Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> Varushka makes two attacks with her <strong><em>life drain</em></strong> and/or <strong><em>mist garrote</em></strong> attacks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Life Drain.</em></strong>  <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. <em>Hit:</em> 10 (2d6 + 3) necrotic damage and Varushka forces the target to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target falls prone and its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.</p>
<p><strong><em>Mist Garrotte.</em></strong>  <em>Ranged Weapon Attack:</em> +7 to hit, range 30 ft., one creature. <em>Hit:</em> 8 (2d4 + 3) slashing damage and the target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or rise vertically 10 feet and remain suspended there until the start of Varushka’s next turn. While suspended, the target’s speed is 0 and it can’t speak or cast a spell that includes a verbal component.</p>
<h3>Bonus Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Vampiric Mist.</em></strong> Tendrils of blood-red mist extrude from Varushka, touching each creature within 5 feet of her. A target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 9 (2d8) necrotic damage and have disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes before the start of Varushka’s next turn. Varushka regains hit points equal to half the damage taken (rounded up), and the target’s hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0.</p>
<p><strong><em>Dark Whispers.</em></strong> Dissonant, mournful whispers fill the air around Varushka, forcing each creature within 30 feet to succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take 3 (1d6) psychic damage and gain disadvantage on the first attack roll or saving throw it makes before the start of Varushka’s next turn.</p>
<h3>Reactions</h3>
<p>Varushka can take up to three reactions per round, but only one per turn. If she would lose her reactions and isn't incapacitated, she loses one reaction instead.</p>
<p><strong><em>Misty Step.</em></strong> In response to taking damage, Varushka teleports up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space. She can then immediately make a <strong><em>life drain</em></strong> attack against a creature within reach.
<p><strong><em>Calming Whispers.</em></strong> In response to a creature that she can see within 10 feet targeting her with an attack or spell, Varushka forces that creature to succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 5 (2d4) psychic damage and gains one level of exhaustion for the next minute. If the creature wasn’t already exhausted, it can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns except this one, decreasing its exhaustion by one level on a success.

# O9. Waking Up
Whether the players appease Varushka or defeat her, unlocking and exiting the nightmare version of the guest suite door causes them to reawaken in their physical bodies in the physical guest suite in Castle Ravenloft approximately twenty minutes before dawn with all the benefits of a long rest. Any players who died in the dream also reawaken in their physical bodies with all the benefits of a long rest. If all members of the party die within the nightmare, they die in reality and do not reawaken.
### O9a. Varushka’s Last Wish
When the players awaken, Varushka appears to them as a **shadow** on the guest suite wall. Read:

<div class="description">
<p>A woman’s shadow appears on the wall, but with no source to cast it. The figure is slender, bearing the silhouettes of a familiar dress and apron.</p>
</div>

The players recognize the **shadow** as bearing the same silhouette as Varushka. Though she can’t speak with the players in this form, Varushka can communicate through simple nods and gestures.

Shortly after appearing to the players, Varushka opens the door to <span class="citation">K51. Closet (p. 70)</span> and pulls down the hook, allowing the trapdoor to swing open. If asked, she shyly attempts to communicate with the players that she wishes for them to follow her through the trapdoor.

If followed, Varushka guides the players through the trapdoor into <span class="citation">K55. Element Room (p. 72)</span>, then leads them through <span class="citation">K54. Familiar Room (p. 71)</span> up <span class="citation">K48. Offstair (p. 70)</span> toward <span class="citation">K57. Tower Roof (p. 72)</span>. These chambers are largely as originally described, but with the following changes:

* ***Element Room.*** The Element Room contains a *potion of fire breath* and two *potions of healing* hidden amongst the bottles and jars. In addition, there are no **Barovian witches** in the nearby <span class="citation">K56. Cauldron (p. 72)</span>, which is instead guarded by four **brooms of animated attack** leaning against the wall. The brooms animate and attack any intruders on sight, but won’t pursue any players who flee past the Familiar Room into <span class="citation">K48. Offstair (p. 70)</span>.
* ***Familiar Room.*** There are no **cats** in this room.

Varushka’s **shadow** halts halfway up <span class="citation">K48. Offstair (p. 70)</span> and gestures to a section of the wall approximately two feet from the floor. A player who inspects this area finds that one of the bricks is loose, allowing it to be removed from the wall. The brick is hollow on the inside, and contains a rolled-up piece of parchment, a small satin pouch, and a copy of the *Seer* Tarokka card.

The parchment is a note written in simple, large lettering. It reads: “When you gave me this card, you said you had seen a sign of our future together. I’m sorry I never worked up the courage to make that future happen."

The pouch contains a diamond ring with a gold band worth 150 gp.

Once the players have retrieved Varushka’s items, her **shadow** vanishes. (See [[#O10. Exploring the Castle]] below for more information should the players attempt to explore the castle after Varushka has left them.)
# O10. Exploring the Castle
If the players attempt to explore the castle after waking up, but before Strahd has sent for them, they can do so by exiting the guest suite via the hidden trapdoor in <span class="citation">K51. Closet (p. 70)</span>. 

The trapdoor exits into the Element Room, which is largely as described in <span class="citation">K55. Element Room (p. 72)</span>, except it also contains a *potion of fire breath* and two *potions of healing* hidden amongst the bottles and jars. There are no **Barovian witches** in the nearby <span class="citation">K56. Cauldron (p. 72)</span>, which is instead guarded by four **brooms of animated attack** leaning against the wall. The brooms animate and attack any intruders on sight, but won’t pursue any players who flee past the Familiar Room into <span class="citation">K48. Offstair (p. 70)</span>.

The Familiar Room is largely as described in <span class="citation">K54. Familiar Room (p. 71)</span>, but currently contains no **cats**.

The players can either ascend or descend <span class="citation">K48. Offstair (p. 70)</span>. Players who descend the staircase encounter the **vampire spawn** Escher, who remains stationed outside of the guest suite door. Players who successfully bypass Escher can continue to explore the castle as described in **Wandering Players** in [[#O6g. The Broken Drawbridge]] above.

Players who ascend the offstair emerge onto <span class="citation">K57. Tower Roof (p. 72)</span>. Players who do so can see a faint, crimson glow pulsating across <span class="citation">K58. Bridge (p. 73)</span> from the interior of <span class="citation">K20. Heart of Sorrow (p. 59)</span>, though the Heart itself isn’t visible from this angle.

The Heart of Sorrow is largely as described in <span class="citation">K20. Heart of Sorrow (p. 59)</span>. However, the Heart is immune to all damage. In addition, when the players enter the tower from <span class="citation">K58. Bridge (p. 73)</span>, read:

<div class="description">
<p>A large archway leads into the tower’s narrowed heights, the path opening into a cold, sixty-foot-wide landing. The landing is flanked by spiral stone stairs, one vanishing into the tower’s peak above, the other descending into the darkness far below. Ten tarnished halberds hang from mounts above the stairs, their rusted steel glinting wickedly with each flash of lightning.</p>
<p>The flickering red glow seems to emanate from a large, misshapen object hovering at the tower’s hollow center—and as you step foot upon the landing, the light suddenly flares to life. Floating ten feet above the landing is a ten-foot-diameter human heart forged of red crystal, its depths thrumming with a deep, scarlet light. A sliver of utter darkness, no more than a few inches long, swirls slowly within its depths.</p>
</div>

> [!info]+ **The Sliver of Darkness**
> The sliver of darkness is the vestige of the Devourer, the fourth sister of the three Ladies of the Fanes. Once known as the Dreamer, she grew envious of the love the First Folk bore for her sisters and forsook her place among them, becoming the Devourer. 
>
> The Ladies—the Seeker, the Weaver, and the Huntress—mournfully struck their youngest sister down to protect the people of the valley. The Devourer’s corpse became the Whispering Wall at Yester Hill, but a god cannot fully die. Many years later, the wizards of the Amber Temple came upon the Devourer’s divine spark and sealed it in an amber sarcophagus at the Amber Temple.
>
> The Devourer was a master of the magic of souls—and so when Strahd first learned of the Grand Conjunction, he realized he could use her knowledge to construct his scheme to escape the Mists. He extracted the vestige of the Devourer from her amber prison in <span class="citation">X33d. Breached Vault (p. 192)</span> and forcefully resealed her in the Heart of Sorrow, where he could call upon her power and knowledge at will. 
>
> The Devourer is no willing participant in Strahd’s schemes. However, while entrapped in the Heart of Sorrow, she is powerless to resist his torments.

The tower shakes and pitches as described in <span class="citation">K20. Heart of Sorrow (p. 59)</span>. If a player falls from the stairs, Strahd appears to save them. Read:

<div class="description">
<p>A pale, clawed hand snatches from the shadows and clasps the base of your neck, stilling your descent. A low, familiar voice murmurs beside your ear, “I hope you would not mean to leave us so soon."</p>
</div>

The hand and voice belong to Strahd, who deposits the player back on the stairs or landing before joining them. 

Strahd also appears if the players approach one of the upper or lower landings or otherwise linger on the landing nearest the Heart of Sorrow. Regardless of the reason for his appearance, read:

<div class="description">
<p>The lightning flashes—and Strahd’s gaunt, pale form looms before you, his crimson eyes glinting in the darkness. “Guests out of their suite before dawn," he intones dryly. “Truly unfortunate."</p>
</div>

After the players have had an opportunity to respond, read or paraphrase:

<div class="description">
<p>Strahd draws himself to his full height, the shadows wrapping around his shoulders like a cloak. His eyes flicker behind you, a second flash of lightning illuminating four humanoid figures crawling like spiders across the stone walls above. “My children are so <em>terribly</em> hungry these days." His long, elegant claws twitch, and for an instant, his nostrils seem to flare like a bat’s. “Shall I allow them to make a meal of you?"
</div>

The four figures are ordinary **vampire spawn**.

The players can convince Strahd to keep the vampire spawn from attacking by making a convincing argument or by showing contrition for disobeying his orders. If they do, Strahd dismisses the spawn with a gesture, sending them retreating onto the exterior of the tower. 

If the players make no attempt to appease Strahd, his eyes narrow, and he warns them quietly that they have been invited as guests in his home, but his patience is not endless—and he would be well within his rights as lord of the castle to command whichever punishment he sees fit.

If appeased, Strahd is intrigued to know what drove the players to exit their chambers, as well as by what means they bypassed Escher at the door. (Strahd is fully aware of the secret trapdoor in the guest suite closet, and his eyes glint with amusement if a player attempts to conceal its existence from him.)

> [!info]+ **Confronting Strahd**
> If confronted regarding Varushka’s nightmare, Strahd raises an eyebrow and notes that the players appear wholly unharmed. “It is not uncommon for rich food to cause ill dreams, after all," he adds serenely. If the players continue to argue that Strahd placed them in danger, Strahd shrugs, adding, “I’m sure you believe what you thought you saw was real. This castle is host to things that have led many a mind astray."

Once appeased, Strahd directs the players to return to their suite, noting he shall send Rahadin to retrieve them shortly. He then adds, “And do try to avoid straying from the path again. It would be most unpleasant to need to revisit this conversation—wouldn’t you agree?" Once the players agree, Strahd departs, assuming his mist form through the use of his ***shapechange*** feature and vanishing into the darkness below.
# O11. Morning at Ravenloft
Approximately an hour after dawn, Rahadin knocks on the door of the guest suite. Once the players open the door to greet him, Rahadin coldly informs the players that the drawbridge has been repaired, and that they are to dress and prepare themselves for their departure. If the players are ready to depart, Rahadin leads them downstairs; otherwise, he instructs them to be ready within the next ten minutes.

Once the players are ready, Rahadin leads them down <span class="citation">K21. South Tower Stair (p. 59)</span> into <span class="citation">K9. Guests’ Hall (p. 56)</span>, where Strahd is waiting to meet them.

Strahd thanks the players for joining him for dinner and informs them that his carriage is waiting outside to return them home. “Simply speak the name of the settlement you wish to be taken to, and my steeds shall carry you there," he advises.

As the players move to depart, Strahd claps one of them on the shoulder and smiles, though no warmth reaches his eyes. “I hope you have learned from our time together that I can be a most gracious host." He briefly pauses, then adds, with a dangerous glint in his eyes, “Shall our paths cross less fortuitously, however, be warned that my benevolence, like all things, has its eventual and inevitable end."

As Rahadin escorts the players into <span class="citation">K1. Front Courtyard (p. 52)</span>, they find that the rain has stopped, leaving only a grey and dreary morning behind. Strahd’s black carriage is waiting for the players, the carriage door opening silently at their approach. (The players can command the horses drawing the carriage to take them to Barovia, Vallaki, or Krezk.)

As the carriage pulls away from the courtyard, the players can catch a final glimpse of Strahd’s brides watching them from the large, shattered, moon-shaped window in <span class="citation">K25. Audience Hall (p. 61)</span>. Read the following, modifying it if either Ludmilla or Volenta are dead:

<div class="description">
<p>As the horses begin to move, your gaze falls upon the great, round window that looks down upon the courtyard. The gaunt figures of Strahd’s three vampiric brides stand beyond it, their visages distorted beneath jagged fingers of broken glass as they watch the carriage slowly pull away.</p>
<p>As the keep shrinks behind you, the chains of the two gate towers shriek and groan, rusted machinery grinding as it slowly heaves the drawbridge back into the air. The carriage rounds a bend in the road—and the sound of the drawbridge slamming shut echoes through the mountains.
</div>

***Milestone.*** Dining with Strahd and vanquishing Varushka completes a story milestone. When the players depart Ravenloft, award each player 3,500 XP. (This should bring the players to 7th level.) Award each player an additional 500 XP if they reunited Varushka with Katarina’s necklace and retrieved Varushka’s hidden cache.
