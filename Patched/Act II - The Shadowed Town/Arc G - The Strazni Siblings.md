_An adventure for five 4th-level characters._

In this arc, shortly after seeing Ireena Kolyana, Izek Strazni realizes that she is—quite literally—the woman of his dreams. 

After learning from his spies that Ireena has most recently resided at the Blue Water Inn, Izek visits the Inn himself in an attempt to uncover her location. If his effort is unsuccessful, he directs the town guard to publish WANTED posters around Vallaki offering a reward for information regarding Ireena’s location.

If the players neither stop Izek nor take extraordinary measures to keep Ireena concealed, Izek finds and kidnaps Ireena two days later, imprisoning her in his room at the Baron’s mansion. Can the players free Ireena from Izek’s clutches—or will they perish in the attempt?

> [!abstract]+ **Lady Wachter's Request**
> If the players kill Izek without accepting Lady Wachter's mission in [[Arc F - Lady Wachter's Wish]], Lady Wachter sends Ernst Larnak the following morning to invite them to tea at Wachterhaus that afternoon "in light of their recent accomplishments." If the players decline Ernst's invitation, Lady Wachter visits the Blue Water Inn in person that evening wearing a deep blue hooded cloak and asks to speak with them in private.
> 
> Regardless of how she and the players meet, Lady Wachter congratulates them on freeing Vallaki of Izek's tyranny and cruelty and frankly asks their blessing to seek the position of Burgomaster from Baron Vallakovich. She is glad to accept the players' assistance in doing so if offered, but otherwise assures them that she believes that he may be persuaded to abdicate peacefully.
> 
> If the players are wary of granting Lady Wachter the "power" of the position, Lady Wachter reassures them that Vallaki's burgomaster holds no intrinsic power except that granted by the townsfolk. "I confess, I am not familiar with the powers of queens and duchesses beyond the Mists," she concedes, "but in Barovia, the burgomaster is a town's administrator—not its ruler."
> 
> "I would pay the salaries of the town's guard, yes," she says, "but they are Morninglord-fearing folk—they would not hesitate to depose me if they felt my ordinances harmful to their neighbors." She adds wryly, "I assure you: I have no wish to *rule* Vallaki. My aspirations, clerical as they are, are far more dull than that." 
> 
> If the players still appear suspicious of the possibility that she might betray them to Strahd, she scoffs, and points out that the players have killed Izek—who she could not herself touch. "If anyone should be frightened, it's I," she says, laughing slightly hysterically. "A band of armed, powerful outsiders have arrived in my small town and killed the most powerful creature within its walls. I am here only because I have faith in your goodwill and your love for my neighbors.")
# G1. The Blue Water Inn
## G1a. Izek’s Visit
Just over a day after catching a glimpse of Ireena Kolyana for the first time—either in the street outside of the Blue Water Inn, in Vallaki’s town square, or in some other location—Izek Strazni recognizes her as the woman that he has seen repeatedly in his dreams and becomes determined to find her. 

Izek soon comes to believe that Ireena is a guest at the Blue Water Inn—either because he observed her in the vicinity of the Blue Water Inn on the players’ first morning in Vallaki, or, unless players disguised her upon their entry into Vallaki, because he learned of her recent arrival from the guards at the gates. (If Izek did not see Ireena outside of the Blue Water Inn and the players kept her disguised upon entering Vallaki, Izek learns of Ireena’s location from one of his spies an additional day later, unless the players have taken extraordinary measures to keep her hidden.)

While the players are away—and preferably during the players’ dinner with Lady Fiona Wachter in [[Arc F - Lady Wachter's Wish]]—Izek visits the Blue Water Inn and demands to know of Ireena’s location, describing her by appearance. Urwin and Danika deny knowledge of her current location and insist that she is not a current guest. Izek demands entry into each room of the inn to search for her, which Urwin and Danika reluctantly allow.

If Ireena is currently staying at the inn, Urwin quietly directs Brom and Bray to retrieve and conceal her in <span class="citation">N2i. Secret Stairs and Hall (p. 101)</span> while he and Danika keep Izek distracted in <span class="citation">N2f. Stable (p. 101)</span>. To keep Izek busy, Danika allows him to search <span class="citation">N2h. Ravens' Loft (p. 101)</span>, allowing him to find the locked chest buried in the hay. Urwin reluctantly complies with Izek's demands to open the chest, and Izek confiscates the 140 ep and 70 pp as "unpaid taxes."

After rummaging through each room of the inn—including Rictavio’s suite—Izek breaks a table, two chairs, and a window in a fit of rage and storms out of the inn.

If the characters claim to be adventurers, Urwin asks them if they would be so kind as to find out what’s holding up the latest shipment, promising them free room and board if they return with the wine.

Urwin’s wife and business partner, Danika Dorakova (LG female human), is also a [wereraven](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17377-wereraven), as are their two sons, Brom and Bray. The boys have only 7 hit points each and, at ages eleven and nine, are too young to be effective combatants.
> 
> At any given time, another 1d4 [wereravens](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17377-wereraven) (members of the Keepers of the Feather) are present at the inn, either perched on the rooftop in raven form or huddled inside in human form. These wereravens are loyal friends of the Martikovs and help protect the inn.
> 
> If the characters earn the trust of the wereravens in Vallaki, the Keepers of the Feather will watch their backs. The next time the characters get themselves in serious trouble, you can have a group of 1d4 [wereravens](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17377-wereraven) show up to rescue or otherwise help them.

> 
> If your card reading reveals that a treasure is hidden at the inn, the Keepers of the Feather don’t reveal where the treasure is until they know the characters are capable of protecting it. As a way of testing their abilities, Urwin gives the characters the following quest:
> 
> Urwin takes you aside and keeps his voice low. “My supply of wine is nearly gone, and the next shipment is overdue. I’ll give you what you seek if you bring me my wine. The vineyard and winery is a few miles west of here. Just follow the Old Svalich Road and the signs.”
> 
> Urwin fails to mention that his cantankerous father, Davian Martikov, owns the local winery and vineyard, the Wizard of Wines ([chapter 12](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/cos/the-wizard-of-wines "chapter 12")). There’s bad blood between Urwin and his father (whom Urwin and Danika refer to as “the old crow”). Although Urwin could easily visit the winery himself, he considers dealing with his father to be a worthy test of the characters’ competence, and he makes good on his promise if they complete the quest and return with his wine shipment.
> 
> Urwin sends a [wereraven](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17377-wereraven) in raven form to observe the party’s progress from a distance. If the characters get in trouble, the wereraven reports to Urwin at once.

> Damp cloaks hang from pegs in the entrance portico. The tavern is packed with tables and chairs, with narrow paths meandering between them. A bar stretches along one wall, under a balcony that can be reached by a wooden staircase that hugs the north wall. Another balcony overhangs an entrance to the east. All the windows are fitted with thick shutters and crossbars. Lanterns hanging above the bar and resting on the tables bathe the room in dull orange light and cast shadows upon the walls, most of which are adorned with wolf heads mounted on wooden plaques.
> 
> The double doors leading into the taproom can be barred shut from within.
> 
> Mounted on braces and tucked into alcoves behind the bar are three wine barrels, each one three-quarters empty. Two of the barrels contain Purple Grapemash No. 3 (a cheap wine), and the third contains Red Dragon Crush (a fine wine). A brass spigot is hammered into each barrel.
> 
> Danika Martikov usually tends bar while her husband busies himself in the kitchen ([area N2e](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/cos/the-town-of-vallaki#N2eKitchen "area N2e")). Their boys, Brom and Bray, scamper about and easily get underfoot.
> 
> Between dawn and noon, there are no patrons here, and the Martikovs are upstairs in their bedrooms ([areas N2o](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/cos/the-town-of-vallaki#N2oBoysBedroom "areas N2o") and [N2p](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/cos/the-town-of-vallaki#N2pMasterBedroom "N2p")) or in the attic ([area N2q](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/cos/the-town-of-vallaki#N2qSecretAttic "area N2q")).
> 
> From noon to dusk, the taproom holds 2d4 local patrons (male and female [commoners](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16829-commoner)). Between dusk and midnight, 2d8 Vallakians are here. In addition, one or more of the following people might be present during this time.
> 
> _**Wolf Hunters.**_ Szoldar Szoldarovich and Yevgeni Krushkin (N male human [scouts](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17007-scout)) are local hunters who frequent the Blue Water Inn. They kill wolves and sell the meat for a living, and their work is dangerous and bloody. Both men are grim and have haunted looks in their eyes.
> 
> These two are dour fellows, but they seldom pass up an opportunity to earn coin. If the characters are looking for guides or information about the land of Barovia, Szoldar and Yevgeni can be of service. They aren’t afraid to venture beyond Vallaki’s walls during the day, and they know the woods and valley well. They’re willing to serve as guides for 5 gp per day, or to provide directions to important landmarks in exchange for free drinks. They think it’s foolish to travel “this cursed realm” at night and won’t do so unless their payment is exorbitant (100 gp or more).
> 
> On rare occasions when he has something to say, Szoldar speaks brusquely, while Yevgeni usually parrots his friend in not so many words. Szoldar has a notch in his bow for every wolf he’s killed, while Yevgeni adds a new swatch to his wolfskin cloak every time he makes a kill. Both men have families but spend most of their time together, either drowning their sorrows or hunting in the woods. Most of the wolf heads that adorn the tavern walls are the result of their handiwork.

> _**Wachter Brothers.**_ Nikolai and Karl Wachter (N male human [nobles](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16966-noble)) are brothers of noble birth. They are brash drunkards always looking for trouble, though they are smart enough not to pick fights with well-armed strangers. Their mother, Fiona Wachter (see [area N4](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/cos/the-town-of-vallaki#N4Wachterhaus "area N4")), is an influential figure in town, but her sons never talk about her. They’d rather listen to tales of the characters’ harrowing adventures or hear about how the characters plan to free Vallaki from the burgomaster’s madness.
> 
> _**Rictavio.**_ The lone guest of the Blue Water Inn at present is a colorfully dressed half-elf bard who goes by the name [Rictavio](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17371-rictavio)—a false identity adopted by the legendary vampire hunter Rudolph van Richten (see [appendix D](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/cos/appendix-d-monsters-and-npcs#RudolphvanRichten "appendix D")). He regales tavern patrons with stories so outrageous as to be hardly believable, yet he asserts they are true indeed. Rictavio claims to be a carnival ringmaster from a distant land. He’s been staying at the inn for almost a month, taking advantage of Urwin Martikov’s generosity and good nature. When he arrived, he was accompanied by a monkey named Piccolo. The monkey wasn’t welcome at the inn, so Rictavio gave it to the local toymaker (see [area N7](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/cos/the-town-of-vallaki#N7BlinskyToys "area N7")).
> 
> Rictavio admits to having no musical talent but manages to entertain locals nonetheless with his stories of faraway places. Twice each day, at dawn and again at dusk, he leaves the inn with a couple of apples and a cooked wolf steak wrapped in a handkerchief. He claims the food is for his portly friend, “the destitute toymaker” ([area N7](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/cos/the-town-of-vallaki#N7BlinskyToys "area N7")) and his pet monkey. In fact, the apples are for his horse Drusilla ([area N2f](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/cos/the-town-of-vallaki#N2fStable "area N2f")), and the steak is for his captured saber-toothed tiger ([area N5](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/cos/the-town-of-vallaki#N5ArasekStockyard "area N5")).
> 
> During his stay at the inn, Rictavio is quietly gathering information on the Keepers of the Feather, trying to figure out the identities of all the wereravens in town. He’s also trying to learn as much as he can about the Vistani, particularly the ones living in the camp just outside town ([area N9](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/cos/the-town-of-vallaki#N9VistaniCamp "area N9")). Once he concludes that they are in league with Strahd, Rictavio plans to unleash his trained saber-toothed tiger upon them, with or without the support of the wereravens.
> 
> Rictavio wears a [hat of disguise](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4651-hat-of-disguise) and a [ring of mind shielding](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4725-ring-of-mind-shielding) to conceal his identity. He carries an iron key that unlocks the door to his carnival wagon ([area N5](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/cos/the-town-of-vallaki#N5ArasekStockyard "area N5")).

> 
> The Martikovs store their wine here. Tucked behind red curtains are three alcoves, each one containing a half-emptied wine barrel lying on its side in a wooden brace. Twelve empty wine barrels are piled two high near the door to the kitchen ([area N2e](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/cos/the-town-of-vallaki#N2eKitchen "area N2e")). All the barrels have the Wizard of Wines name burned into them.
> 
> Nine of the fifteen barrels, including two of the barrels in the curtained alcoves, have the following label burned into their sides, under the winery’s name: Purple Grapemash No. 3. Six of the fifteen barrels, including one of the barrels in the curtained alcoves, have a different label: Red Dragon Crush.

> 
> Urwin Martikov, who prepares most of the meals, is found here throughout the day. He occasionally receives help from his two boys, but they are easily distracted. A cupboard against the east wall holds most of the inn’s supply of cutlery and dishware, none of it valuable. A door in the west wall leads outside and is usually barred from the inside.
> 
> A secret door at the west end of the south wall can be pushed open to reveal a wooden staircase that leads up to [area N2i](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/cos/the-town-of-vallaki#N2iSecretStairsandHall "area N2i").

> You hear the squawking of birds and the plaintive whinny of a horse as you peer inside this stable. The stalls are clean and well maintained. One of them contains a gray mare. A small door is set into the east wall, and a wooden ladder gives access to a loft overhead. Perched on the wooden railing that encloses the loft are dozens of ravens.
> 
> Any character who has a horse can keep it here for 1 sp per night. The gray mare is a [draft horse](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16844-draft-horse) named Drusilla, and she likes apples. The horse belongs to Rictavio (see [area N2c](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/cos/the-town-of-vallaki#N2cTaproom "area N2c")).

> Dim light spilling in through a pair of dirt-encrusted windows reveals piles of hay with pitchforks sticking out of them. Ravens rule this roost—you can see hundreds of them.
> 
> Characters who search the loft thoroughly find three pitchforks and a locked wooden chest buried under a pile of hay (see “Treasure” below), next to a secret door. If the characters tamper with the chest, the ravens gather into four [swarms of ravens](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17033-swarm-of-ravens) and attack. If two swarms are killed, the others flee. Otherwise, they cease their attacks if the characters leave the chest alone. If the fighting continues for more than 3 rounds, Urwin Martikov and two other wereravens hear the ruckus and investigate (in human form).
> 
> A secret door in the back of the loft can be pushed open to reveal a bedchamber ([area N2p](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/cos/the-town-of-vallaki#N2pMasterBedroom "area N2p")) beyond. No ability check is required to spot the secret door, because light in the room beyond slips through the door’s cracks.

At dawn, he leaves to check on his horse ([area N2f](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/cos/the-town-of-vallaki#N2fStable "area N2f")) and his wagon ([area N5](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/cos/the-town-of-vallaki#N5ArasekStockyard "area N5")), returning to the inn around noon. Between noon and dusk, there’s a 40 percent chance he is here; otherwise, he’s in the taproom ([area N2c](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/cos/the-town-of-vallaki#N2cTaproom "area N2c")). At dusk, he leaves the inn to tend to his horse and his wagon again, then returns to his room to retire for the night.

His writing makes frequent mention of conversations with Drusilla (which the journal fails to mention is the name of Rictavio’s horse) and recounts many long and tedious journeys by wagon. Rictavio has also written about various “oddities” he has seen in his travels, including the following:
> 
> - A “werehare” child (a boy who transforms into a rabbit on nights of the full moon)
> - A half-orc woman named Gorabacha who could chew through iron chains

The next time that the players return to the Blue Water Inn, they find that the inn is closed to non-guests for the evening, with all of its shutters and doors closed to the public. 

The debris from the broken table and chairs have been placed outside by the shed just outside of the inn’s front door, and the glass from the broken window has been swept into a neat pile, though a cold draft is seeping in through the shutters. 

[[Non-Player Characters#Urwin Martikov|Urwin]], who is holding a broom and dustpan as he gathers splinters and shards from the taproom floor, greets the players wearily upon their return. He can provide the players with the following information:

* Izek Strazni, the baron’s enforcer and captain of the guard, visited the Blue Water Inn earlier that day and demanded the location of a woman matching the description of the players’ companion.
* Izek tore apart the inn in an effort to find her, but was ultimately unsuccessful. In the process, he damaged some of the inn’s property and ransacked the inn’s guest rooms. 
* If Izek took the coins from the Martikovs’ locked chest, Urwin notes that he also took some items with him, but that thankfully no one was harmed. If asked, Urwin dismisses the confiscated coins as “some savings of ours,” but reiterates his relief that Ireena and the players are safe.

Urwin sincerely apologizes to the players for the damage to their rooms, and promises that he and [[Non-Player Characters#Danika Dorakova|Danika]] are working hard to ensure that they will be cleaned up and ready for the players to sleep in that night.

If the players indicate an interest in attacking Izek for his transgressions or to stop him from finding Ireena, Urwin warns them that Izek is a powerful and dangerous foe, protected by the town guard at nearly all hours of the day. Should the players challenge him outright, it shall surely be suicide. 

If the players appear dead-set on challenging Izek, Urwin reluctantly advises them to seek the counsel of Lady Fiona Wachter, who is known to be a steadfast enemy of the Baron. He also offers to uncover details regarding Izek’s schedule and activities in order to assist the players’ efforts. 

Urwin declines to reveal his sources, but notes only that some “friends” of his are adept at finding information without being detected.

> A bed for the night costs 1 ep. Characters looking for something to eat are fed hot beet soup and fresh bread at no additional charge. A cooked wolf steak costs 1 ep.

> The inn offers a pint of Purple Grapemash No. 3 wine for 3 cp, or a pint of the superior Red Dragon Crush wine for 1 sp. Urwin is hurt if the characters complain about the wines, for his family makes them.
> 
> The inn’s wine supply is almost depleted, and the latest delivery from the Wizard of Wines winery is overdue. If the characters claim to be adventurers, Urwin asks them if they would be so kind as to find out what’s holding up the latest shipment, promising them free room and board if they return with the wine.

Urwin’s wife and business partner, Danika Dorakova (LG female human), is also a [wereraven](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17377-wereraven), as are their two sons, Brom and Bray. The boys have only 7 hit points each and, at ages eleven and nine, are too young to be effective combatants.
> 
> At any given time, another 1d4 [wereravens](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17377-wereraven) (members of the Keepers of the Feather) are present at the inn, either perched on the rooftop in raven form or huddled inside in human form. These wereravens are loyal friends of the Martikovs and help protect the inn.
> 
> If the characters earn the trust of the wereravens in Vallaki, the Keepers of the Feather will watch their backs. The next time the characters get themselves in serious trouble, you can have a group of 1d4 [wereravens](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17377-wereraven) show up to rescue or otherwise help them.

> If your card reading reveals that a treasure is hidden at the inn, the Keepers of the Feather don’t reveal where the treasure is until they know the characters are capable of protecting it. As a way of testing their abilities, Urwin gives the characters the following quest:
> 
> Urwin takes you aside and keeps his voice low. “My supply of wine is nearly gone, and the next shipment is overdue. I’ll give you what you seek if you bring me my wine. The vineyard and winery is a few miles west of here. Just follow the Old Svalich Road and the signs.”
> 
> Urwin fails to mention that his cantankerous father, Davian Martikov, owns the local winery and vineyard, the Wizard of Wines ([chapter 12](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/cos/the-wizard-of-wines "chapter 12")). There’s bad blood between Urwin and his father (whom Urwin and Danika refer to as “the old crow”). Although Urwin could easily visit the winery himself, he considers dealing with his father to be a worthy test of the characters’ competence, and he makes good on his promise if they complete the quest and return with his wine shipment.
> 
> Urwin sends a [wereraven](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17377-wereraven) in raven form to observe the party’s progress from a distance. If the characters get in trouble, the wereraven reports to Urwin at once.

> 
> Damp cloaks hang from pegs in the entrance portico. The tavern is packed with tables and chairs, with narrow paths meandering between them. A bar stretches along one wall, under a balcony that can be reached by a wooden staircase that hugs the north wall. Another balcony overhangs an entrance to the east. All the windows are fitted with thick shutters and crossbars. Lanterns hanging above the bar and resting on the tables bathe the room in dull orange light and cast shadows upon the walls, most of which are adorned with wolf heads mounted on wooden plaques.
> 
> The double doors leading into the taproom can be barred shut from within.
> 
> Mounted on braces and tucked into alcoves behind the bar are three wine barrels, each one three-quarters empty. Two of the barrels contain Purple Grapemash No. 3 (a cheap wine), and the third contains Red Dragon Crush (a fine wine). A brass spigot is hammered into each barrel.
> 
> Danika Martikov usually tends bar while her husband busies himself in the kitchen ([area N2e](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/cos/the-town-of-vallaki#N2eKitchen "area N2e")). Their boys, Brom and Bray, scamper about and easily get underfoot.
> 
> Between dawn and noon, there are no patrons here, and the Martikovs are upstairs in their bedrooms ([areas N2o](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/cos/the-town-of-vallaki#N2oBoysBedroom "areas N2o") and [N2p](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/cos/the-town-of-vallaki#N2pMasterBedroom "N2p")) or in the attic ([area N2q](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/cos/the-town-of-vallaki#N2qSecretAttic "area N2q")).
> 
> From noon to dusk, the taproom holds 2d4 local patrons (male and female [commoners](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16829-commoner)). Between dusk and midnight, 2d8 Vallakians are here. In addition, one or more of the following people might be present during this time.
> 
> _**Wolf Hunters.**_ Szoldar Szoldarovich and Yevgeni Krushkin (N male human [scouts](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17007-scout)) are local hunters who frequent the Blue Water Inn. They kill wolves and sell the meat for a living, and their work is dangerous and bloody. Both men are grim and have haunted looks in their eyes.
> 
> These two are dour fellows, but they seldom pass up an opportunity to earn coin. If the characters are looking for guides or information about the land of Barovia, Szoldar and Yevgeni can be of service. They aren’t afraid to venture beyond Vallaki’s walls during the day, and they know the woods and valley well. They’re willing to serve as guides for 5 gp per day, or to provide directions to important landmarks in exchange for free drinks. They think it’s foolish to travel “this cursed realm” at night and won’t do so unless their payment is exorbitant (100 gp or more).
> 
> On rare occasions when he has something to say, Szoldar speaks brusquely, while Yevgeni usually parrots his friend in not so many words. Szoldar has a notch in his bow for every wolf he’s killed, while Yevgeni adds a new swatch to his wolfskin cloak every time he makes a kill. Both men have families but spend most of their time together, either drowning their sorrows or hunting in the woods. Most of the wolf heads that adorn the tavern walls are the result of their handiwork.

They are brash drunkards always looking for trouble, though they are smart enough not to pick fights with well-armed strangers. Their mother, Fiona Wachter (see [area N4](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/cos/the-town-of-vallaki#N4Wachterhaus "area N4")), is an influential figure in town, but her sons never talk about her. They’d rather listen to tales of the characters’ harrowing adventures or hear about how the characters plan to free Vallaki from the burgomaster’s madness.
> 
> _**Rictavio.**_ The lone guest of the Blue Water Inn at present is a colorfully dressed half-elf bard who goes by the name [Rictavio](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17371-rictavio)—a false identity adopted by the legendary vampire hunter Rudolph van Richten (see [appendix D](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/cos/appendix-d-monsters-and-npcs#RudolphvanRichten "appendix D")). He regales tavern patrons with stories so outrageous as to be hardly believable, yet he asserts they are true indeed. Rictavio claims to be a carnival ringmaster from a distant land. He’s been staying at the inn for almost a month, taking advantage of Urwin Martikov’s generosity and good nature. When he arrived, he was accompanied by a monkey named Piccolo. The monkey wasn’t welcome at the inn, so Rictavio gave it to the local toymaker (see [area N7](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/cos/the-town-of-vallaki#N7BlinskyToys "area N7")).
> 
> Rictavio admits to having no musical talent but manages to entertain locals nonetheless with his stories of faraway places. Twice each day, at dawn and again at dusk, he leaves the inn with a couple of apples and a cooked wolf steak wrapped in a handkerchief. He claims the food is for his portly friend, “the destitute toymaker” ([area N7](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/cos/the-town-of-vallaki#N7BlinskyToys "area N7")) and his pet monkey. In fact, the apples are for his horse Drusilla ([area N2f](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/cos/the-town-of-vallaki#N2fStable "area N2f")), and the steak is for his captured saber-toothed tiger ([area N5](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/cos/the-town-of-vallaki#N5ArasekStockyard "area N5")).
> 
> During his stay at the inn, Rictavio is quietly gathering information on the Keepers of the Feather, trying to figure out the identities of all the wereravens in town. He’s also trying to learn as much as he can about the Vistani, particularly the ones living in the camp just outside town ([area N9](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/cos/the-town-of-vallaki#N9VistaniCamp "area N9")). Once he concludes that they are in league with Strahd, Rictavio plans to unleash his trained saber-toothed tiger upon them, with or without the support of the wereravens.
> 
> Rictavio wears a [hat of disguise](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4651-hat-of-disguise) and a [ring of mind shielding](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4725-ring-of-mind-shielding) to conceal his identity. He carries an iron key that unlocks the door to his carnival wagon ([area N5](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/cos/the-town-of-vallaki#N5ArasekStockyard "area N5")).

> 
> This hallway contains three curtained alcoves as well as a larger area stuffed with wine barrels.
> 
> The Martikovs store their wine here. Tucked behind red curtains are three alcoves, each one containing a half-emptied wine barrel lying on its side in a wooden brace. Twelve empty wine barrels are piled two high near the door to the kitchen ([area N2e](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/cos/the-town-of-vallaki#N2eKitchen "area N2e")). All the barrels have the Wizard of Wines name burned into them.
>

Six of the fifteen barrels, including one of the barrels in the curtained alcoves, have a different label: Red Dragon Crush.

> 
> Urwin Martikov, who prepares most of the meals, is found here throughout the day. He occasionally receives help from his two boys, but they are easily distracted. A cupboard against the east wall holds most of the inn’s supply of cutlery and dishware, none of it valuable. A door in the west wall leads outside and is usually barred from the inside.
> 
> A secret door at the west end of the south wall can be pushed open to reveal a wooden staircase that leads up to [area N2i](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/cos/the-town-of-vallaki#N2iSecretStairsandHall "area N2i").

> 
> You hear the squawking of birds and the plaintive whinny of a horse as you peer inside this stable. The stalls are clean and well maintained. One of them contains a gray mare. A small door is set into the east wall, and a wooden ladder gives access to a loft overhead. Perched on the wooden railing that encloses the loft are dozens of ravens.
> 
> Any character who has a horse can keep it here for 1 sp per night. The gray mare is a [draft horse](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16844-draft-horse) named Drusilla, and she likes apples. The horse belongs to Rictavio (see [area N2c](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/cos/the-town-of-vallaki#N2cTaproom "area N2c")).

> 
> Dim light spilling in through a pair of dirt-encrusted windows reveals piles of hay with pitchforks sticking out of them. Ravens rule this roost—you can see hundreds of them.
> 
> Characters who search the loft thoroughly find three pitchforks and a locked wooden chest buried under a pile of hay (see “Treasure” below), next to a secret door. If the characters tamper with the chest, the ravens gather into four [swarms of ravens](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17033-swarm-of-ravens) and attack. If two swarms are killed, the others flee. Otherwise, they cease their attacks if the characters leave the chest alone. If the fighting continues for more than 3 rounds, Urwin Martikov and two other wereravens hear the ruckus and investigate (in human form).
> 
> A secret door in the back of the loft can be pushed open to reveal a bedchamber ([area N2p](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/cos/the-town-of-vallaki#N2pMasterBedroom "area N2p")) beyond. No ability check is required to spot the secret door, because light in the room beyond slips through the door’s cracks.

At dawn, he leaves to check on his horse ([area N2f](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/cos/the-town-of-vallaki#N2fStable "area N2f")) and his wagon ([area N5](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/cos/the-town-of-vallaki#N5ArasekStockyard "area N5")), returning to the inn around noon. Between noon and dusk, there’s a 40 percent chance he is here; otherwise, he’s in the taproom ([area N2c](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/cos/the-town-of-vallaki#N2cTaproom "area N2c")). At dusk, he leaves the inn to tend to his horse and his wagon again, then returns to his room to retire for the night.

> _**Rictavio’s Journal.**_ The journal on the desk is a bit of artifice that Rictavio created to perpetuate the illusion that he is an entertainer in search of new acts for his traveling carnival. His writing makes frequent mention of conversations with Drusilla (which the journal fails to mention is the name of Rictavio’s horse) and recounts many long and tedious journeys by wagon. Rictavio has also written about various “oddities” he has seen in his travels, including the following:
> 
> - A “werehare” child (a boy who transforms into a rabbit on nights of the full moon)
> - A half-orc woman named Gorabacha who could chew through iron chains
> - A giant, man-eating plant that had the most remarkable singing voice
> - A pair of conjoined goblins
> - A small man with no legs named Filmore Stunk, who could drink whole casks of wine without getting drunk

If [[Non-Player Characters#Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] was at the inn when Izek arrived, [[Non-Player Characters#Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] further informs the players that [[Non-Player Characters#Danika Dorakova|Danika]] is comforting her in <span class="citation">N2e. Kitchen (p. 101)</span> while brewing a batch of hot mulled wine to steady her nerves. (Brom and Bray have been sent to their room for the night—not as a punishment, but to keep them safe should Izek return. Urwin has promised both new toys as a reward for their selflessness and bravery.)

Ireena is shaken, confused, and disturbed by Izek’s visit, but deeply grateful to the Martikovs for their efforts to keep her from harm. (If asked, she can inform the players of the existence of the inn’s secret corridor and staircase, but asks them to promise to keep the Martikovs’ secrets safe.) 

If Ireena was at St. Andral's Church when Izek visited the inn, she visits the inn the following morning and sees the aftermath herself.

***Ireena's Choice.*** Whether Ireena was at the inn or church during Izek's attack, she is filled with guilt, rage, and frustration upon learning of it. With a tremble in her voice, she demands that the players allow her to accompany them should they decide to put a stop to Izek's rampage. Ireena doesn't care about Izek's motivation; she simply wants others to stop suffering for their decisions to protect her.

If the players insist that she remain at the inn, Ireena asks if they truly believe her to be "helpless and incompetent." "Am I a piece of porcelain, to be sealed away so that it can never be chipped?" she demands furiously. "Am I a princess, to be locked away in a tower so that no dragon can snatch me? Did you forget that my father and brother trained me to wield a sword? Or do you mean to take this decision from me, just as Strazni and the Devil do?"

Ireena, determined and stubborn, can't be convinced to remain at the inn or church, and insists on accompanying the players if they attempt to leave without her. Players can keep her from attempting to join them only by succeeding on a DC 16 Charisma (Deception) check to deceive her or by succeeding on a DC 14 Dexterity (Stealth) check to slip away when she's distracted.

> [!abstract]+ **Urwin's Aid**
>
> If the players request Urwin’s aid in tracking Izek, Urwin meets them in the taproom the following morning to share the following information, though he politely declines to reveal his sources:
> 
> - Izek is accompanied for most of the day by two Vallakian **guards**. The guards keep a close eye on his surroundings, making it difficult to ambush him. However, Izek usually dismisses the guards and retires to one of several preferred haunts to drink around dusk.
> - Izek’s day-to-day schedule varies, but he reliably takes his midday meal in Vallaki’s town square, delivered by the Baron’s cook. He returns every night to Baron Vallakovich’s mansion to sleep.
> - Strange figures have been seen going in and out of Wachterhaus, the home of Lady Fiona Wachter, one of the Baron’s fiercest political enemies. Rumor has it that one of her servants has been shadowing Izek around town for the past two weeks. She might have aid to offer.
> 
> If the players journey to Lady Wachter’s estate to seek her assistance, they begin [[Arc F - Lady Wachter's Wish]].

# G2. The Streets of Vallaki
One day after his visit to the Blue Water Inn, Izek directs the town guards to begin publishing posters requesting information regarding the location of a woman matching Ireena’s description. Each poster includes a sketch that roughly matches Ireena’s appearance and offers a reward of five gold pieces for information delivered to Izek Strazni at the Baron’s mansion.
# G3. The Kidnapping
At dawn on the fourth day after the players arrived in Vallaki, unless the players have taken sufficient precautions to ensure that Ireena remains completely concealed from the public, a Vallakian delivers a tip to the Burgomaster’s mansion regarding her current location. 

The next time that Ireena and the players are apart that day, [[Non-Player Characters#Izek Strazni|Izek]], joined by four **guards**, breaks into Ireena’s current location and attempts to kidnap her. [[Non-Player Characters#Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] bites off his left ear in the process, permanently giving him disadvantage on all Wisdom (Perception) checks involving hearing.

* ***Blue Water Inn.*** If Ireena is still at the Blue Water Inn, [[Non-Player Characters#Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] and [[Non-Player Characters#Danika Dorakova|Danika]], alerted by a **wereraven** about Izek’s approach, swiftly move once to hide her in the hidden staircase. However, Izek notices a strand of Ireena’s hair caught in the secret door and forces the door open, finding her. As he hauls Ireena away, he commands the guards to place Urwin in the town stocks. He uses his ***hurl flame*** ability to set fire to the Blue Water Inn, causing severe property damage before Danika and six **wereraven** members of the Keepers of the Feather are able to extinguish it using water from the inn’s well.
* ***St. Andral’s Church.*** If Ireena has been moved to St. Andral’s Church, Izek interrupts [[Non-Player Characters#Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Petrovich]] in the middle of a sermon and demands to know Ireena’s location. Despite Father Petrovich’s protests, Izek finds Ireena in the priest’s office (which Father Petrovich and Yeska have converted into a makeshift third bedroom) and seizes her. Izek coldly vows that he will return to punish the church for hiding Ireena from him, but departs without causing further harm.

If Izek is successful, he then takes Ireena by force to his room in the Baron’s mansion (described in **N3j. Izek's Bedroom**, p. 107), where he binds her with rope, gags her, and places her on his bed. He then takes a chair and several bottles of wine from the first floor, places the chair in his room beside the bed, and remains there until the dawn of the Festival of the Blazing Sun.

> [!lore]+ **Izek's Sacrifice**
> Shortly after Izek brings Ireena to the mansion, Ireena demands to know the reason for her kidnapping. If Ireena is unaware of her relationship to Izek, Izek then reveals it; otherwise, Izek demands to know why she kept away from him despite knowing.
> 
> In either case, Ireena is disturbed by the depth of Izek's psychopathy and obsession, and her loyalty to her adoptive family and village anger Izek, who deems her a "fake" sent to deceive him. Spiraling into madness, Izek decides that he must sacrifice Ireena in flames to bring his "real" sister back to him. 
> 
> At dawn on the morning of the Festival of the Blazing Sun, Izek removes the offerings to the Morninglord—incense, salted meats, wooden carvings, and jewelry—from the hollow interior of the wicker sun, dumps them on the floor of his bedroom, and secretly replaces them with a bound and gagged Ireena. Izek then insists on personally guarding and escorting the wicker sun to the Festival. 
> 
> If the players fail to rescue Ireena, the wicker sun is brought to the town square at nine o'clock in the morning, and burned at noon at the height of the "festivities," killing Ireena.

# G4. The Rescue
The players can rescue Ireena from Izek’s clutches by first gaining access to his bedroom in the Baron’s mansion. They can do so by infiltrating the mansion or openly storming it.

In either case, if the players are found in a place where they’re not supposed to be, an occupant of the mansion can raise the alarm by shouting for aid. If the alarm is raised, twelve **guards** arrive at the mansion two minutes later. 

The NPCs in the mansion ordinarily behave as follows:

* Baron Vallakovich can generally be found in <span class="citation">N3l. Library (p. 107)</span> during the day, and in <span class="citation">N3o. Master Bedroom (p. 108)</span> at night. He is accompanied by his two **mastiffs**, Fang and Claw, at all times. If he finds the players trespassing, he sets Fang and Claw to attack them, but raises the alarm if the dogs are defeated.
* Baroness Lydia Petrovna can generally be found in <span class="citation">N3c. Dining Room (p. 106)</span> during the day and in <span class="citation">N3o. Master Bedroom (p. 108)</span> at night. If she finds the players trespassing during the day, she assumes that they are guests of her husband, Vargas, and greets them accordingly; otherwise, she screams, then faints. 
* [[Non-Player Characters#Victor Vallakovich|Victor Vallakovich]] can generally be found in <span class="citation">N3t. Victor's Workroom (p. 109)</span> both day and night. If he finds the players trespassing, he greets them warily and demands to know their names and business. (He won’t raise the alarm if his curiosity is satisfied.)
* Tereska, the cook, can generally be found in <span class="citation">N3g. Kitchen (p. 106)</span> during the day, and in <span class="citation">N3f. Servants' Quarters (p. 106)</span> at night. If she finds the players trespassing, she raises the alarm unless they agree to leave.
* Clavdia, the maid, can generally be found on the second floor during the morning, on the first floor during the afternoon, and in <span class="citation">N3f. Servants’ Quarters (p. 106)</span> at night. If she finds the players trespassing, she immediately raises the alarm.

[[Non-Player Characters#Izek Strazni|Izek]] remains in his bedroom with Ireena at all times and refuses to allow anyone else to enter, including the Baron and the household staff. If the players loot Izek’s body following his death, they can recover his silvered battleaxe, a pouch containing 35 gp, and an amber shard of Seriach, the Hell Hound Whisperer. (See the **Amber Shard** appendix for more information about amber shards.)

> [!info]+ **Don't Wake Izek**
>
> When the players first arrive at Izek’s bedroom, roll 1d20 to determine if he is asleep, with advantage if it is nighttime. Izek is asleep in his chair on a roll of 15 or higher.
>
> If a player attempts to sneak into the room while Izek is asleep, they find it impossible to reach the bed without passing near Izek’s chair. As they do so, he clumsily wraps a hand around their wrist while snoring, forcing the player to make a successful DC 12 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to extricate themselves without awakening him.
>
> If the players free Ireena and move to exit from the room with her, one of the floorboards creaks loudly, briefly stirring Izek from his deep slumber. With his eyes still closed, he drowsily reaches as if to grab for an object in front of him, murmuring, “Ireena.” If handed one of his dolls, he clutches it to his chest and falls back asleep. Otherwise, he awakens on the following round.

> [!info]+ **Fire in the Mansion!**
>
> Izek’s fire-based abilities are likely to set the wooden floors and paneling of the mansion aflame. If they do, apply the following rules:
>
> * Each contiguous collection of ignited squares counts as a single **fire**. On initiative count 20 of each round, for each fire, roll a number of d4s equal to the number of squares in that fire. For each 4 rolled, an additional square adjacent to the fire also ignites (your choice), becoming a part of the fire. Ignited squares can include either floors or walls. (An ignited wall is engulfed with flames on both sides.)
> * When the fire spreads, each creature within its area must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save, that creature can immediately move to an adjacent, unoccupied square within 5 feet.
> * A creature that enters the fire or begins its turn there for the first time on a turn takes 1d8 fire damage.
> * All squares within 10 feet of a **fire** are heavily obscured by smoke. A creature other than Izek that starts its turn in the smoke must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be **poisoned** until the start of its next turn. Undead and constructs succeed on the saving throw automatically.
>
> One minute after the first fires ignite, Victor Vallakovich descends to the battlefield if able and commands all combatants to move behind him. He then casts _cone of cold_ to extinguish all burning squares.

## G4a. Infiltrating the Manor
If the players infiltrate the manor and successfully make their way to Izek’s bedroom, the door is locked as described in <span class="citation">N3j. Izek's Bedroom (p. 107)</span>. If the players attempt to pick the lock and [[Non-Player Characters#Izek Strazni|Izek]] is awake (see ***Don’t Wake Izek*** below), they must also succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity (Stealth) check to do so without alerting him.

> [!warning]+ **Surprising Izek**
> Don't forget that Izek, even if surprised, can still use his reactions after the end of his first turn in combat. See <span class="citation">Surprise (<em>Player's Handbook</em>, p. 189)</span> for more information.

The players will find it difficult to lure Izek from his bedroom while Ireena is present, but can do so with sufficiently creative and provocative efforts—assuming, of course, they roll sufficiently high. Otherwise, Izek draws his silvered battleaxe and fights at the slightest provocation.

During the battle, Izek can break through one of the interior walls of the Baron’s manor by expending 15 feet of his movement. If he does, he takes 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage.

If conscious, Ireena uses a dagger concealed in her boot to cut herself free from Izek's restraints on her first turn in combat. She then joins the battle on the second round of combat.

<p><strong><em>Second Phase.</em></strong> When Izek is reduced to 0 hit points, his arms and axe are engulfed in flames, the barbs on his fiendish arm grow longer and sharper, and his skin grows red and begins to smoke. His statistics are then instantly replaced by the statistics of his second form. His initiative count doesn’t change. Excess damage doesn't carry over to his new form, but he retains any conditions he had in his previous form.</p>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> Izek makes two attacks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Silvered Battleaxe.</em></strong> <em>Melee weapon attack:</em> +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 11 (1d10 + 5) slashing damage and Izek can push the target up to 5 ft. away.</p>
<p><strong><em>Flame Hurl.</em></strong> <em>Ranged spell attack:</em> +5 to hit, range 60 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 7 (2d6) fire damage.</p>
<h3>Bonus Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Slicing Whirl.</em></strong> Izek whirls his battleaxe around him. Each creature within a 5-foot radius must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 5 (2d4) slashing damage and fall prone. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw takes half damage and doesn’t fall prone.</p>
<p><strong><em>Flame Volley.</em></strong> Izek conjures a volley of fiery orbs that rain down on a point within 60 ft. that he can see. Each creature within 10 ft. of that point must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 7 (2d6) fire damage.</p>
<h3>Reactions</h3>
<p>Izek can take up to three reactions per round, but only one per turn. If Izek would lose his reactions and isn't incapacitated, he loses one reaction instead.</p>
<p><strong><em>Indomitable.</em></strong> <strong>Trigger:</strong> A hostile creature ends its turn. <strong>Effect:</strong> Izek can repeat the saving throw against one effect or condition currently affecting it. (This reaction has no effect if the effect or condition didn’t originally require it to fail a saving throw.)</p>
<p><strong><em>Forceful Retreat.</em></strong> In response to taking damage from a melee attack, Izek makes a shove attack against the attacker. He can then immediately move up to 15 ft. away from the attacker without provoking opportunity attacks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Vengeful Strike.</em></strong> In response to taking damage from an attack or spell, Izek can move up to 15 ft. toward the attacker without provoking opportunity attacks. He can then immediately make an attack against that creature with his battleaxe.</p>

<h3>Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> Izek makes two melee attacks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Silvered Battleaxe.</em></strong> <em>Melee weapon attack:</em> +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 10 (1d8 + 5) slashing damage plus 2 (1d4) fire damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Burning Punch.</em></strong> <em>Melee weapon attack:</em> +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 8 (1d4 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 2 (1d4) fire damage, and Izek can push the target up to 5 ft. away. On a critical hit, the target must also succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be dazed until the start of Izek’s next turn. (That creature can move or take one action on its turn, not both. It also can’t take a bonus action or a reaction.)</p>
<p><strong><em>Flaming Wave.</em></strong> A wave of flames sweeps out from Izek in a line that is 60 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in the line must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 11 (2d10) fire damage. The fire ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.</p>
<h3>Bonus Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Flame Burst.</em></strong> Izek slams his battleaxe into the ground, causing a torrent of flames to swirl around him. Each creature within 5 feet must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 7 (2d6) fire damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Explosive Blast.</em></strong> A bright streak flashes from Izek’s clawed hand to a point he chooses within 90 feet and then blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame. Each creature in a 5-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 7 (2d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A target that fails the save is also knocked prone. The fire spreads around corners. It ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.</p>
<h3>Reactions</h3>
<p>Izek can take up to three reactions per round, but only one per turn. If Izek would lose his reactions and isn't incapacitated, he loses one reaction instead.</p>
<p><strong><em>Indomitable.</em></strong> <strong>Trigger:</strong> A hostile creature ends its turn. <strong>Effect:</strong> Izek can repeat the saving throw against one effect or condition currently affecting it. (This reaction has no effect if the effect or condition didn’t originally require it to fail a saving throw.)</p>
<p><strong><em>Hot Pursuit.</em></strong> In response to taking damage from an attack or spell, Izek propels himself forward with a jet of crackling flames, moving up to 30 feet without provoking opportunity attacks. He can then immediately make a <strong><em>burning punch</em></strong> attack against a creature within range.</p>
<p><strong><em>Cinder Sparks.</em></strong> In response to taking damage from a melee attack, Izek causes the air around him to burst with swirling cinders. The attacker must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 2 (1d4) fire damage and be blinded until the end of its next turn.</p>
<p><strong><em>Retaliatory Burn (1/round).</em></strong> In response to taking damage from a melee attack made with a metal weapon, Izek causes the object to glow red-hot until the start of his next turn. Any creature in physical contact with the weapon immediately takes 4 (1d8) fire damage and must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or drop the weapon if it can. If it doesn’t drop the object, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the start of Izek’s next turn.</p>

## G4b. Storming the Manor
If the players cause a ruckus at the front door or on the first floor of the manor, [[Non-Player Characters#Izek Strazni|Izek]] overhears them and exits his bedroom, bringing his silvered battleaxe in case of battle. He fights at the slightest provocation.
## G4c. Ireena's Gratitude
[[Non-Player Characters#Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] is deeply disturbed by Izek's obsession with her. If the players inform her that she is Izek's sister, she mourns the child she once must have known, but not the man that he became. She reaffirms that, no matter who believes otherwise, she is and chooses to be Ireena Kolyana—not Ireena Strazni, or anyone else.

***Milestone.*** Rescuing Ireena from Izek's clutches completes a story milestone. When Ireena is escorted to safety, award each player 750 XP, or 1,500 XP instead if Izek was defeated.

> [!info]+ **No Double-Counting**
> The players can earn a maximum of 1,500 XP for completing [[Arc F - Lady Wachter's Wish]] and/or [[Arc G - The Strazni Siblings]]. Parties that rescue Ireena then later kill Izek will earn 750 XP for the former and an additional 750 XP for the latter.
# Design Notes: The Strazni Siblings
This arc has been expanded to provide a more explicit "ticking clock" that drives the players into conflict with Izek Strazni, and as an inciting incident that pushes Ireena to journey with the players and take agency in her fight against Strahd.

***The Blue Water Inn.*** Izek's attack on the Blue Water Inn has been added to provide the players with an additional motivation to seek his death—especially if they are mistrustful of Lady Wachter's motives or doubtful of the benefits of removing her obstacles to power. 

Izek's attack also serves to motivate Ireena to join the players in defeating him, developing her character arc as she moves from passivity to agency and laying the foundations for her ultimate decision to journey with the players at the beginning of **Act III: The Broken Land.**

Urwin's aid has been added to discourage the players from fighting Izek directly (i.e., in a fair fight), to direct them toward Lady Wachter (and therefore serve as a backup hook to [[Arc F - Lady Wachter's Wish]]), and to foreshadow his involvement with the Keepers of the Feather, who the players will learn more about in [[Arc J - The Stolen Gem]].

***The Kidnapping.*** Izek's kidnapping of Ireena has been implemented as a failsafe penalty if the players decline to take any action to defeat him before this date (which will most likely be on or about the players' fourth full day in Vallaki).

***The Rescue.*** Izek's ability to break through the interior walls of the mansion has been added to create a more dynamic environment in what would otherwise be a cramped, closed-quarters space.
